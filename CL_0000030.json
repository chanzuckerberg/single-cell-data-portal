{"description": "Glioblasts are primarily found in the central nervous system and are an integral part of the developing and mature brain tissue. They are primitive progenitor cells with the ability to self-renew and can differentiate into neuroglia, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, two primary cells involved in neurotransmission and protection of brain tissue. \n\nWhen glioblast multiplication is dysregulated, it can lead to harmful manifestations, most notably in the form of an aggressive brain tumor known as Glioblastoma multiforme, one of the most malignant types of neural cancers.", "references": ["https://www.wjgnet.com/1948-0210/full/v6/i2/230.htm", "https://neuraldevelopment.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13064-016-0075-9", "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.12.6242", "https://f1000research.com/articles/9-233/v1"]}
