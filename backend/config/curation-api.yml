        Retrieve temporary AWS credentials for uploading Dataset source files to S3 to create

        * `<collection_id>` MUST NOT be a published Collection. Only uploads to private Collections
        (unpublished OR ongoing Revision) will be processed.

        * If there is no Dataset with tag `<curator_tag>` in `<collection_id>`, a new Dataset SHALL be added.

        * If there is an existing Dataset with tag `<curator_tag>` in `<collection_id>`, the existing Dataset
        SHALL be replaced.


        The response contains the credentials required for uploading to our AWS S3 bucket:

        * access_key

        * secret_access_key

        * session_token


        To upload the files to S3, use the Python boto3 package. Once a file is successfully uploaded, it wil be
        processed and added to the Collection (specified in the S3 key path) with no further user action required.
        Use `GET /curation/collections/{collection_id}/datasets/` with `curator_tag` or `id` query parameter  to check 
        on the processing status for a given Dataset.

        A Dataset uploaded directly to S3 will appear in the Collection only once the Dataset has started
        processing.
