        Retrieve temporary AWS credentials for uploading Dataset source files to S3 to create
        or update Datasets for the specified Collection.

        * Uploads to <root_bucket> MUST take the form of `s3://<root_bucket>/<collection_id>/<curator_tag>`.

        * `<collection_id>` MUST NOT be a published Collection. Only uploads to private Collections
        (unpublished OR ongoing Revision) will be processed.

        * If there is no Dataset with tag `<curator_tag>` in `<collection_id>`, a new Dataset SHALL be added.

        * If there is an existing Dataset with tag `<curator_tag>` in `<collection_id>`, the existing Dataset
        SHALL be replaced.


        The response contains the credentials required for uploading to our AWS S3 bucket:

        * access_key

        * secret_access_key

        * session_token


        To upload the files to S3, use the Python boto3 package. Once a file is successfully uploaded, it wil be
        processed and added to the Collection (specified in the S3 key path) with no further user action required.
        Include an email address in the S3 file upload metadata to receive processing and error notifications.
        Alternatively, use `/curation/collections/{collection_id}/datasets/status` to check on the processing
        status for a given Dataset.
