    ## Working with versions

    #### Access to published version history
    The CZ CELLxGENE Discover API supports access to all published versions of Collections and Datasets. For example,
    if a Dataset was published and then later updated and published again, then both Dataset Versions can be accessed.

    #### Different types of identifiers
    The Collection identifier collection_id is set during the creation of a Collection; it does not change, even if the
    Collection is updated. It always refers to the latest published version of the Collection and is the required
    identifier to use with Collection endpoints.

    The Collection Version identifier `collection_version_id` refers to one specific published version of a Collection
    and is required by the Collection Version endpoint.

    The Dataset identifier dataset_id is set during the creation of a Dataset; it does not change, even if the Dataset
    is updated. It always refers to the latest published version of the Dataset and is the required identifier to use
    with Dataset endpoints.

    The Dataset Version identifier `dataset_version_id` refers to one specific published version of a Dataset and is
    required by the Dataset Version endpoint.

    **Important Note:** if a Dataset is NOT updated during a revision of its parent Collection and the revision is
    published, then its Dataset Version (and identifier `dataset_version_id`) do not change even though there is a new
    Collection Version (and identifier `collection_version_id`).

      description: |
        Retrieve temporary AWS credentials for uploading Dataset source files to S3 to create
        or update Datasets for the specified Collection.


        * `<collection_id>` MUST NOT be a published Collection. Only uploads to private Collections
        (unpublished OR ongoing Revision) will be processed.

        * If there is an existing Dataset with `<dataset_id>` in `<collection_id>`, the existing Dataset
        SHALL be replaced.


        The response contains the credentials required for uploading to our AWS S3 bucket:

        * access_key

        * secret_access_key

        * session_token


        We recommend using an AWS SDK in your preferred language to perform the s3 upload, such as `boto3` in Python or
        `aws.s3` in R. To upload a datafile to a Dataset, the id of the Dataset (`<dataset_id>`) must be appended to the
        s3 key prefix (`<UploadKeyPrefix>`) that is returned in the response body from this endpoint. You must also
        retrieve the `Bucket` attribute on the response body. These values must be applied accordingly to the
        'upload file' (or equivalent) function in the s3 module of whichever AWS SDK you choose to use. Generally,
        these functions take a 'key' or 'object' argument in addition to a 'bucket' argument. Taking the values from the
        aforementioned `"UploadKeyPrefix"` and `"Bucket"` attributes that are returned on the response to this endpoint,
        this resolves to the following:

        * the object or key: `<UploadKeyPrefix>/<dataset_id>` (note: you must include the joining slash `/`)

        * the bucket: `<Bucket>`


        Once a file is successfully uploaded, it wil be processed and added to the Collection that you specified in your
        initial request to this endpoint, with no further user action required. Use
        `GET /curation/collections/{collection_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}` to retrieve metadata for the
        Dataset in question in order to check on its processing status.

        A Dataset uploaded directly to S3 in this manner will appear in the Collection only once the Dataset has started
        processing.

        * Required: provide your access token in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
