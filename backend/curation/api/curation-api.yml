        For each Collection in the list, the Datasets for that Collection include a subset of Dataset metadata as a 
        preview. To retrieve full Dataset metadata for a specific Collection, GET /v1/collections/{collection_id} must 
        be used.

        The default `visibility` is PUBLIC. When visibility is PUBLIC, then a list of all public Collections is 
        returned. 

        When the visibility parameter is set to PRIVATE, a list of all private Collections or private revisions of 
        public Collections that the user is authorized to access is returned. An access token MUST be set in the request
        header as: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

        In order to retrieve the following curator-specific attributes, include an access token in your API request:

        - `revising_in` (the id of an associated Revision for this Collection, if one exists)

        * Optional: provide your access token in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

        Retrieve temporary AWS credentials for uploading Dataset source files to S3 to create
        or update Datasets for the specified Collection.


        * `<collection_id>` MUST NOT be a published Collection. Only uploads to private Collections
        (unpublished OR ongoing Revision) will be processed.

        * If there is an existing Dataset with `<dataset_id>` in `<collection_id>`, the existing Dataset
        SHALL be replaced.


        The response contains the credentials required for uploading to our AWS S3 bucket:

        * access_key

        * secret_access_key

        * session_token


        We recommend using an AWS SDK in your preferred language to perform the s3 upload, such as `boto3` in Python or
        `aws.s3` in R. To upload a datafile to a Dataset, the id of the Dataset (`<dataset_id>`) must be appended to the
        s3 key prefix (`<UploadKeyPrefix>`) that is returned in the response body from this endpoint. You must also
        retrieve the `Bucket` attribute on the response body. These values must be applied accordingly to the
        'upload file' (or equivalent) function in the s3 module of whichever AWS SDK you choose to use. Generally,
        these functions take a 'key' or 'object' argument in addition to a 'bucket' argument. Taking the values from the
        aforementioned `"UploadKeyPrefix"` and `"Bucket"` attributes that are returned on the response to this endpoint,
        this resolves to the following:

        * the object or key: `<UploadKeyPrefix>/<dataset_id>` (note: you must include the joining slash `/`)

        * the bucket: `<Bucket>`


        Once a file is successfully uploaded, it wil be processed and added to the Collection that you specified in your
        initial request to this endpoint, with no further user action required. Use
        `GET /curation/collections/{collection_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}` to retrieve metadata for the
        Dataset in question in order to check on its processing status.

        A Dataset uploaded directly to S3 in this manner will appear in the Collection only once the Dataset has started
        processing.

        * Required: provide your access token in the request header as `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
