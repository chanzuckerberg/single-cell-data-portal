## Pull Request Protocols

The followings guidelines allows the core developers to manage the workload of performing PR reviews with a 24 hour SLO more manageable.

- Please do not request code reviews for PRs that are failing unit tests, deployment, or lint, unless it was failing prior to your PR (in which case Iâ€™d recommend figuring out why it was failing prior to your PR to make sure it is being addressed).

- Please do not request code reviews on draft PRs unless you're specifically asking for someone to scan something or validate (in which case, please contact them beforehand).

- Once you've fully addressed all the comments, please re-request a review and/or offline ping. Sometimes it is difficult figuring out which PRs have fully addressed all the comments and which ones have not.

- Please resolve comments that have been addressed.

- If someone has not responded on a PR for a while, please ping them directly. It's preferable that PRs get closed instead of waiting indefinitely for someone to review while new PRs keep piling up.

- For not urgent but safe/trivial PRs, please use label `bot/merge` and request reviews, so `czimergebot` will automatically merge the PR for you once you get at least one approval + when all Github PR checks pass

- For urgent but safe/trivial PRs, please feel free to force merge now, but still tag reviewers, in case they spot low priority fixes that can be done as a followup PR

- Please title your PR's with the intended squash commit message. This title should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard (`<type>[optional scope]: <description>`). PR titles will be linted via the [lint-pr workflow](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-data-portal/blob/main/.github/workflows/lint-pr.yml).
