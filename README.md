The Corpora Data Portal (CDP) enables the publication, discovery and exploration of interoperable
single-cell datasets. Data contributors can upload, review and publish datasets for private or
public use. Via the portal, data consumers are able to discover, download and connect data to visualization tools
such as [cellxgene](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/cellxgene/posts/cellxgene_cziscience_com) to perform further
analysis. The goal of the CDP is to catalyze distributed collaboration of single-cell research by providing a large,
well-labeled repository of interoperable datasets.

| `CORPORA_LOCAL_DEV` | If this variable is set to any value, the Corpora app will look for the database on **localhost:5432** and will use the aws secret _corpora/backend/\${DEPLOYMENT_STAGE}/database_local_. | Any                                   |

### Commands

| Command                 | Description                                                                          | Notes                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make fmt`              | Auto-format codebase using [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).                 | This should be run before merging in any changes.                                                    |
| `make lint`             | Perform lint checks on codebase using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/). | This should be run before merging in any changes.                                                    |

### Deployment

1. Set `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE` and `AWS_PROFILE` according to the environment to be deployed.
1. [Deploy Backend](backend/entrypoints/api_server/README.md#Deploy)
1. [Deploy Cloudfront-invalidator](backend/entrypoints/cloudfront_invalidator/README.md#Deploy)
1. [Deploy Frontend](frontend/README.md#Deployment)

### Database Procedures
see [Data Portal Database Procedures](backend/database/README.md)

### Running unittests

1. Set `AWS_PROFILE`
1. Run the tests `$ make unit-test`

### Installing Chamber
For running functional tests below, you will need to install Chamber on your machine. Chamber
is a tool for reading secrets stored in AWS Secret Store and Parameter Store.

On Linux, go to https://github.com/segmentio/chamber/releases to download the latest version >= 2.9.0,
and add it somewhere on your path.

On Mac, run
```
brew install chamber
```

### Running functional tests

1. Install Chamber, using the instructions above
1. Set `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE` and `AWS_PROFILE` according to the environment to be deployed.
1. In another terminal run `make functional-test`

### Running local functional tests

1. Install Chamber, using the instructions above
1. Set `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE` and `AWS_PROFILE` according to the environment to be deployed.
1. Run `make local-init` to launch a local dev environment
1. Run `make functional-test`

### Upload processing container
The upload processing container is split into 2 parts: a base container that contains R
libraries, and the Data Portal upload application code that build on top of this.

Because the base container takes a long time to build and is expected to change
infrequently, the container is built separately from the standard release process.

#### Building the image
The base image is built using Github actions. It is built both nightly, and whenever
the Dockerfile.processing_base file is changed.

The Data Portal upload application code by default uses the base image tagged with the tag
"branch-main" (which the nightly and on-change base image build reassigns).

If a new base image build is needed but the Dockerfile has no functional change (e.g.
upstream R libraries versions have changed), the Dockerfile.processing_image can be
modified with a non-functional to force the build (e.g. adding a blank line).

In the rare event a new build of the base image needs to be built without Github Actions
(e.g. Github Actions is down), follow the steps
[Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/pushing-and-pulling-docker-images)
for creating a personal access token, and build locally and push like any other Docker image.
