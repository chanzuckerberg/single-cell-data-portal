Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social 'control' (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially-unacceptable outcomes).nnMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex. - definition adapted from Wikipedia.", "UBERON:0004648": "A muscularis mucosa that is part of a esophagus.", "UBERON:0010225": "A nuclear complex which in mammals consists of four parts, the hypothalamus, epithalamus, ventral thalamus, and dorsal thalamus[WP,modified].", "UBERON:0005969": "A pore-like structure surrounding the entire circumference of the anterior chamber of the eye through which aqueous humor circulates[MP].", "UBERON:0006761": "The edge of the cornea where it joins the sclera; the limbus is a common site for the occurrence of corneal epithelial neoplasm.", "UBERON:0003889": "Initial section of the oviduct through which the ova pass from the ovary to the uterus.", "UBERON:0003902": "The part of the retina that contains neurons and photoreceptor cells[GO].", "UBERON:0008612": "A muscular partition formed by the levatores ani and coccygei, with which may be included the parietal pelvic fascia on their upper and lower aspects.
