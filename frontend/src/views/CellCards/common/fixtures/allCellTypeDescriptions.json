They carry out functions such as energy production, protein synthesis, and cell division. Cells vary in size, shape and function depending on their location and role in the body. While some cells function independently, others work together to form tissues and organs.\n\nThere are two main types of cells - eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are simpler in structure and lack a membrane-bound nucleus. They are found in organisms such as bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, are more complex and include a nucleus that houses the cell\u2019s genetic material. Eukaryotic cells are found in all organisms except for bacteria and archaea.\n\nCell function is controlled by the interaction of numerous molecules, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates within the cell membrane. The membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, consisting of polar heads and nonpolar tails that form a barrier between the inside and the outside of the cell. Various processes, including diffusion and active transport, allow molecules and ions to pass through this barrier, maintaining the cell\u2019s internal environment.\n\nOverall, cells are essential to the survival of living organisms, carrying out critical functions that allow for the maintenance of life.

They are the primary cells that make up the brain, spinal cord and nervous system. The structure of a neuron is unique, it consists of a cell body with extensions known as dendrites which receive signals from other neurons or sensory cells and transmit that information towards the cell body. From the cell body, a long projection called an axon carries impulses away from the cell body and towards other neurons or muscles and glands.\n\nNeurons function in the nervous system to transmit information in the form of electrical and chemical signals. These signals allow us to think, learn, process and respond to sensory information about the world around us. Neurons can be categorized in different ways based on their function, location, and shape. Sensory neurons receive sensory information such as touch, sight or sound and transmit it towards the central nervous system. Motor neurons take instructions from the central nervous system and coordinate muscle movements. Interneurons are the connecting link between sensory and motor neurons, allowing for processing and integration of information.\n\nThe function of neurons in the body is essential. Damage to neurons can cause serious neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, highlighting how detrimental their function is when disrupted.

They have specialized structures called receptors that are activated when these stimuli are detected. The receptors then generate electrical signals, called impulses, that travel along the axons of sensory neurons to the central nervous system.\n\nOnce the impulses reach the central nervous system, they are processed and interpreted by the brain and spinal cord, which then generate appropriate responses. For example, when a sensory neuron detects a painful stimulus, such as a hot stove, it sends impulses to the brain, which responds by triggering the withdrawal reflex to remove the affected body part from the heat source.\n\nIn summary, sensory neurons are crucial cells that help us perceive and respond to the different stimuli in our environment.

The first meiotic division produces two secondary spermatocytes, and the second meiotic division divides these cells into four haploid spermatids.\n\nSpermatogenesis is a complex process that involves several stages, and it is crucial for the maintenance of the male reproductive system. Spermatocytes are essential for the production of healthy sperm cells and the transfer of genetic material to offspring. Any abnormalities or mutations in the spermatocyte can result in infertility or disorders in the offspring. Therefore, understanding the function and behavior of spermatocytes is vital for researchers in the field of reproductive biology.", "CL:0000020": "A spermatogonium is a type of male germ cell that is responsible for producing spermatozoa (sperm cells) through a process called spermatogenesis. In mammals, spermatogonia are present in the testis and are located in the seminiferous tubules. These cells undergo mitotic division to produce either more spermatogonia or primary spermatocytes.\n\nSpermatogenesis begins at puberty and continues throughout a male's life. It is a highly regulated process that is necessary for the production of functional spermatozoa. The first step in spermatogenesis is the differentiation of spermatogonia into primary spermatocytes. This process is triggered by hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone. Primary spermatocytes then undergo a process of meiosis, which results in the formation of haploid secondary spermatocytes and eventually, spermatids. Spermatids differentiate into spermatozoa, which are then released into the epididymis for maturation and storage until ejaculation.\n\nOverall, the function of spermatogonia is to produce germ cells that eventually give rise to spermatozoa. This process is crucial for male fertility and reproduction. Any disruptions in spermatogenesis can lead to infertility or impaired sperm function, which may pose challenges for conception and fertility. Understanding the biology of spermatogonia and spermatogenesis is important for developing new treatments for male infertility and for improving our overall understanding of reproductive biology.", "CL:0000018": "Spermatids are haploid cells that are formed during the process of spermatogenesis in males. They are the next stage after the completion of meiosis II and are derived from secondary spermatocytes. During spermatidogenesis, each secondary spermatocyte divides into two haploid spermatids. These cells carry the genetic information required for the formation of an offspring. \n\nSpermatozoa are formed through the differentiation of spermatids. This differentiation involves the shedding of most of the cytoplasm, formation of the tail and the realization of the acrosome. Additionally, the cellular differentiation helps to establish the cell's function as a specialized structure that fertilizes the female gamete. The tail in the spermatozoa helps achieve motility, which is an important factor during fertilization.\n\nSpermatids have a unique and important role in fertilization, as they transform into functional spermatozoa that can fertilize the female gamete. The process of spermatogenesis in males is continuous and ensures that there is a sufficient number of mature and functional sperm cells. Understanding the function of spermatids is essential in developing male reproductive health interventions that can improve fertility.", "CL:0000413": "A haploid cell is a cell that contains only one set of chromosomes. In humans, haploid cells are male and female gametes, or sperm and egg cells. Before fertilization, these cells undergo meiosis, a specialized cell division process that results in the reduction of the chromosome number by half. This reduction enables the fusion of the gametes during fertilization, leading to the formation of a diploid zygote with a full complement of chromosomes. Haploid cells are therefore crucial for sexual reproduction and the inheritance of genetic material.\n\nHaploid cells have a unique function in the process of genetic diversity. During meiosis, genetic recombination occurs, where chromosomes from the mother and father of the organism can exchange segments of DNA. This exchange results in genetic variation, which is important for the adaptation and evolution of species. The haploid state is also important for maintaining genetic diversity in populations over time.\n\nIn addition to their role in sexual reproduction, haploid cells have other functions in certain organisms. For example, in fungi, the haploid state is the dominant state during the life cycle, and haploid cells undergo mitosis to produce identical haploid offspring. Haploid cells have also been used in genetic and molecular biology research as model systems to study basic cellular processes and to analyze gene function. Overall, haploid cells play an essential role in the reproduction and genetic diversity of many organisms.", "CL:0000657": "A secondary spermatocyte is a haploid cell that is the product of the first meiotic division during spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is the process by which sperm cells are produced in the male testes, and it involves a series of cell divisions and maturation processes. Secondary spermatocytes are formed when diploid primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I, resulting in two haploid daughter cells.\n\nThe main function of secondary spermatocytes is to undergo the second meiotic division in order to produce four haploid spermatids. During meiosis II, the secondary spermatocytes divide once more to create two haploid daughter cells, each containing half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. These daughter cells go on to differentiate into spermatids, which then mature into functional sperm cells.\n\nSecondary spermatocytes are important because they are a critical step in the process of spermatogenesis, which is essential for sexual reproduction in males. The production of functional sperm cells is necessary for fertilization and the continuation of the species. If there are any abnormalities or defects in the formation or function of secondary spermatocytes, it can lead to infertility or other reproductive issues.", "CL:0000019": "Sperm cells, or spermatozoa, are male reproductive cells responsible for fertilizing the female egg. Sperm cells are categorized as gametes, meaning they contain half of the genetic material necessary for reproduction. Sperm cells are produced within the testes through a process called spermatogenesis. During spermatogenesis, immature sperm cells undergo a series of developmental stages, including multiple cell divisions and differentiation, to form the mature, highly specialized sperm cells capable of fertilization.\n\nSperm cells are specialized cells designed to fulfill a singular function: merging with the female egg cell to initiate fertilization. To achieve this, sperm cells are highly equipped with a tail or flagellum that propels them forward, ensuring they can swim towards the egg. In addition to their motility, sperm cells also contain specialized structures, including the acrosome, which contains enzymes that enable the sperm to penetrate the protective outer layer of the female egg cell. Without these unique features, sperm cells would be unable to fulfill their critical reproductive function.\n\nDuring sexual intercourse, sperm cells are released into the female reproductive tract and swim through the cervix and uterus towards the fallopian tubes, where they may encounter and fertilize the egg cell. Only a small fraction of the millions of sperm released during ejaculation will make it to the egg, highlighting the importance of sperm motility and health in fertility.

It is a small, streamlined cell that consists of three distinct parts: the head, midpiece, and tail. The head of the sperm contains genetic material or DNA, which carries the male genetic information needed to form a new organism. The midpiece, a highly metabolic region, contains specialized mitochondria that produce the energy required for the sperm to swim towards the egg. The tail is a long and thin structure that propels the sperm forward towards the egg during sexual reproduction.\n\nThe male gamete is critical in sexual reproduction as it is responsible for carrying the paternal genetic material needed for fertilization. It is a highly specialized cell that underwent a unique developmental process to give it the necessary structure and function needed for its essential role in reproduction. Despite its small size, a male gamete is a crucial component of sexual reproduction and plays a vital role in the transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.", "CL:0000021": "A female germ cell, also known as an oocyte, is a specialized cell type involved in reproduction.

At this point, they begin to undergo maturation and are released from the ovaries during ovulation. If fertilization occurs, the oocyte combines with the male gamete to form a zygote, which becomes an embryo and eventually a fetus.\n\nFemale germ cells are unique in that they have a very large size, measuring up to 200 micrometers in diameter. They also undergo a unique type of cell division, called meiosis, which reduces their chromosome number from diploid to haploid, allowing for the creation of a genetically diverse offspring. The maturation of oocytes is regulated by hormones such as estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).\n\nIn conclusion, the female germ cell is a crucial cell type in reproduction, responsible for producing the female gamete necessary for fertilization.

They undergo a series of divisions, giving rise to progenitor cells called oogonia, which then undergo meiosis to give rise to the haploid eggs that will be fertilized by sperm to form the zygote. Any defects in the stem cells may result in chromosomal abnormalities, spontaneous abortion or infertility. Therefore, understanding the developmental biology of these cells is of utmost importance in reproductive biology.\n\nResearch on these cells has gained tremendous momentum in recent years, with scientists interested in their potential applications in regenerative medicine and fertility treatments. The isolation and characterization of female germ line stem cells have opened up the possibility of artificial gamete production and genetic engineering, which could help combat the increasing rate of infertility and genetic disorders.

This process involves numerous regulatory factors and signaling pathways, many of which are still being studied by researchers. Although oogonial cells are generally considered quiescent in adult females, recent evidence suggests that they may have the ability to regenerate after injury or disease, leading to exciting new possibilities for regenerative medicine.\n\nDespite their importance, oogonial cells are still poorly understood. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to uncover new insights into the molecular and genetic mechanisms governing oocyte development.

PGCs are either specified during embryogenesis or formed during early development from pluripotent stem cells. These cells go through a series of complex differentiation events in order to become fully functional gametes.\n\nDuring embryonic development, PGCs arise from the epiblast, the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, and migrate to the developing gonads where they differentiate into oocytes or sperm. Once in the gonads, PGCs undergo a number of molecular changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, that help to establish their sex-specific developmental programs. In mammals, these programs are regulated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, which initiates male sex determination.\n\nPGCs have also been shown to play an important role in reproductive cloning and assisted reproductive technologies.

In the developing nervous system, neuroblasts migrate to specific regions of the brain where they differentiate into different types of neurons, contributing to the formation of complex neural circuits. In the adult brain, neuroblasts are located in specific areas, such as the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the hippocampus, where they continue to produce new neurons throughout life.\n\nIn addition to their role in neurogenesis, neuroblasts also play important roles in regulating brain functions such as learning, memory, and behavior. Studies have shown that disruptions to the proliferation and differentiation of neuroblasts can lead to a wide range of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.

These cells are derived from the neural ectoderm and appear following neural plate folding. They form a pair of elongated and bilaterally symmetrical placodes located at the lateral edges of the neural plate. Neuroplacodal cells are distinctive because they express a unique set of pluripotency and neural crest genes that differ from those present in the neural plate boundary. \n\nNeuroplacodal cells have the ability to differentiate into various sensory cells that are crucial for the formation of cranial nerves, including inner ear hair cells, vestibular ganglion neurons, and sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. As such, they play a critical role in the development of the auditory, vestibular and trigeminal systems. The differentiation of these cells is regulated by a series of transcription factors and signaling molecules, including Pax2, Sox2, FGF, WNTs, and BMPs among others.

In addition, surface ectodermal cells contribute to the development of certain glands, such as the mammary and salivary glands.\n\nThe key function of surface ectodermal cells is to generate and maintain the outermost layer of the developing embryo, which serves as a protective barrier against the external environment. This is accomplished through a complex process of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, which is tightly regulated by various signaling pathways and transcription factors. For example, the Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in the specification and segregation of surface ectodermal cells from other cell types during early embryogenesis.\n\nOnce differentiated, surface ectodermal cells continue to perform various specialized functions, depending on their location and the tissue they contribute to. For instance, in the skin, these cells produce keratin proteins, a key component of the epidermis, as well as melanin, which gives skin its characteristic color.

These cells are responsible for secreting a portion of their cytoplasm, along with the secretory product, into the lumen of the gland. This process is called apocrine secretion, and it differs from other exocrine cells that use either merocrine or holocrine secretion.\n\nThe most well-studied apocrine cells are found in the mammary glands, where they play a crucial role in the production of milk. During lactation, apocrine cells in the mammary gland undergo extensive lipid and protein synthesis, which is subsequently released into the lumen of the gland through the process of apocrine secretion. This results in the formation of milk, which is then ultimately released from the nipple during breastfeeding.\n\nWhile apocrine cells are best known for their role in milk production, they also have important functions in other exocrine glands. For example, in sweat glands, apocrine cells produce and secrete the organic compounds that are responsible for the characteristic odor of sweat.

The steroid hormones include testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, aldosterone, and cortisol, among others. These hormones have several functions in the body, including the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, immune function, and stress response.\n\nThe mechanisms of steroid hormone secretion vary depending on the type of cell and hormone involved. Generally, steroid hormone-secreting cells produce and secrete hormones in response to specific signals or stimuli, such as the release of other hormones or neurotransmitters, changes in the levels of ions or nutrients, or environmental cues. The synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones also involve several enzymes, transporters, and binding proteins that contribute to their specificity, stability, and distribution in the body.\n\nSteroid hormone-secreting cells play crucial roles in maintaining the homeostatic balance of the body and responding to various physiological and pathological conditions. For example, the adrenal cortex produces cortisol in response to stress, which helps to increase the availability of glucose and other nutrients for the body to use during the fight-or-flight response. Similarly, the testes and ovaries produce testosterone and estrogen, respectively, which influence the development and function of reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics.

These cells are present in the ovary and are responsible for the production of progesterone, a hormone that is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy. Luteal cells are formed from the remnants of the follicle after ovulation and are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland.\n\nThe main function of luteal cells is to produce and secrete progesterone, which is a steroid hormone that prepares the uterus for pregnancy. Progesterone helps to thicken the lining of the uterus, creating a suitable environment for the implantation of a fertilized egg. In addition, progesterone also suppresses the immune system, preventing it from rejecting the developing embryo. Progesterone levels are highest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and during early pregnancy, and if pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum undergoes regression, leading to a decrease in progesterone levels.\n\nLuteal cells are also involved in the production of other hormones such as estrogen and inhibin. Estrogen helps to regulate the menstrual cycle and is responsible for the development of secondary sex characteristics in females. Inhibin, on the other hand, inhibits the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which is necessary for the development of follicles. Therefore, luteal cells play a critical role in the regulation of female reproductive function and fertility.", "CL:0000179": "Progesterone-secreting cells are a subset of endocrine cells predominantly present in the corpus luteum, but also found in the adrenal gland, placenta, and testis.

Ecdysteroid secreting cells are located in the prothoracic glands, which are small glands located in close proximity to the tracheal system and are part of the insect\u2019s endocrine system.\n\nThe function of the ecdysteroid secreting cell is heavily regulated by the level of juvenile hormone (JH) in the insect\u2019s body. When JH levels are high, the prothoracic glands will not secrete ecdysteroids, and the insect will remain in a juvenile state. Conversely, when JH levels are low, the prothoracic glands will begin to secrete ecdysteroids, which triggers the molting process and ultimately leads to metamorphosis. This finely-tuned system of hormone regulation ensures that insects and crustaceans undergo metamorphosis at the appropriate time in their development, allowing them to grow and reproduce in a highly coordinated manner.\n\nIn conclusion, ecdysteroid secreting cells are a crucial component of the endocrine system in insects and crustaceans. These cells are responsible for the production and secretion of ecdysteroids, which initiate the molting and metamorphosis process in these organisms.

As cells differentiate, they may follow different developmental pathways, leading to the formation of distinct cell types. In some cases, a cell type may be necessary for early development but is no longer needed as the organism matures. In these instances, the cell type may become obsolete and be replaced by other cell types that are more suited to carry out the necessary functions.\n\nWhile obsolete cells by lineage may no longer be present in an organism, they still play an important role in understanding the developmental history of organisms.

They are found primarily in the bone marrow, although they can also be found in other tissues, such as the liver and spleen. Megakaryocytes are unique in that they are very large and can contain up to 64 nuclei, which allows them to produce a large number of platelets.\n\nIn order to produce platelets, megakaryocytes undergo a process called endomitosis, during which their nucleus undergoes multiple rounds of replication without cell division, resulting in a polyploid cell. This process is essential for platelet production, as it allows the cell to produce a large number of platelets without dividing. Once the megakaryocyte has produced enough platelets, fragments of the cell's cytoplasm and membrane break off to form individual platelets, which are then released into the blood.\n\nMegakaryocytes play a critical role in maintaining the health of the circulatory system.

This cell type was originally identified in mice and was found to be present in the bone marrow and spleen. However, further research has since shown that pstO/ALC cells are likely a result of contamination by other cell types during isolation procedures and are not a distinct cell population. \n\nWhile pstO/ALC cells are no longer considered a valid cell type, their initial characterization suggested that they may have played a role in B cell development and differentiation. Specifically, it was thought that pstO/ALC cells were precursors to mature B cells. However, as our knowledge of B cell development has advanced, this hypothesis has been called into question. \n\nOverall, while pstO/ALC cells were once thought to be an important cell type in the immune system, their characterization has since been discredited.

These cells are thought to be derived from the same precursor cells as sieve elements and are intimately associated with sieve tubes. However, unlike sieve elements, which are responsible for conducting the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant, companion cells serve a supportive role to sieve elements by providing them with energy and other necessary resources.\n\nCompanion cells function primarily in the loading and unloading of sucrose into and out of sieve elements. Sucrose is synthesized in mesophyll cells of leaves and is transported into companion cells through plasmodesmata, small cytoplasmic channels that connect the cells of plant tissues. Once inside a companion cell, sucrose is broken down into glucose and fructose, releasing energy in the process. The energy thus obtained is used to drive the active transport of sucrose into the adjacent sieve element. Conversely, during the unloading of sucrose in sink tissues, companion cells play a critical role in the maintenance of concentration gradients between the phloem and the surrounding tissues.\n\nIn addition to their role in sucrose transport and metabolism, companion cells are also involved in a number of other processes, such as the regulation of water flow in the phloem and the defense against pathogens. Their peculiar morphology, characterized by an intricate network of plasmodesmata and a high degree of specialization, makes them essential components of the phloem and an exciting field of study in plant biology.", "CL:0000285": "The obsolete stalk cell is a cell type that plays a crucial role in the developmental biology of organisms belonging to the family Dictyosteliidae in the phylum Amoebozoa. This unicellular organism undergoes a complex developmental life cycle that involves a transition from a single cell to a multicellular organism. During this process, the obsolete stalk cell forms a long, thin stalk that connects the mature fruiting body to the substrate on which it grows. The purpose of this stalk is to elevate the fruiting body or spore mass above the substrate, which facilitates the dispersal of spores.\n\nThe development of the obsolete stalk cell is tightly regulated by a set of signaling pathways, which activate transcription factors that drive stalk cell differentiation. Under certain conditions, such as nutrient limitation or the presence of quorum sensing signals, a subset of cells within a Dictyosteliidae colony will differentiate into obsolete stalk cells. These cells cease to proliferate and undergo a series of morphological changes, including the extension of their cellular membrane and the deposition of extracellular matrix components, which ultimately results in the formation of a stalk.\n\nThe formation of the obsolete stalk cell is a remarkable example of the cellular differentiation that occurs during the development of multicellular organisms. While the mechanism of obsolete stalk cell differentiation is well-characterized, many questions remain about the signaling pathways that regulate this process, as well as the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to its regulation.

These cells are responsible for the growth and spread of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium. Hyphal cells are characterized by their long, thin shape and lack of septa, which allows for the flow of nutrients and organelles throughout the cell. Many hyphal cells also feature branching tips, which help to increase surface area for absorption.\n\nThe main function of hyphal cells is to facilitate the growth and spread of filamentous fungi. They do this by continuing to elongate at their tips, allowing the fungus to penetrate new substrates such as soil or decaying organic matter. As the hyphae grow, they release digestive enzymes to break down surrounding organic matter, allowing the fungus to absorb the nutrients it requires for survival and growth. Additionally, some hyphal cells are specialized for reproduction, with reproductive structures such as spores forming at the tips of the hyphae.\n\nDespite their simple appearance, hyphal cells play a vital role in the ecology of many ecosystems. They are an important part of the carbon and nutrient cycling in soil, and some filamentous fungi have been used for centuries in the production of food and antibiotics.

It is called \"obsolete\" because it does not play an active role in fertilization, despite its presence during the process. Instead, its primary function is believed to be in supporting the growth and development of the female gametophyte.\n\nDuring fertilization, the male gametophyte, which is contained within a pollen grain, enters the female gametophyte through a structure called the micropyle. The two sperm cells contained within the pollen grain then move towards the two synergid cells that are flanking the egg cell. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form the zygote, while the other sperm cell fuses with the two synergid cells to contribute to the formation of a nutrient-rich structure called the endosperm.\n\nWhile the obsolete synergid does not participate in fertilization itself, it is thought to play a role in the regulation of fertilization. Research has shown that this cell type may help to prevent multiple pollen grains from fertilizing a single egg cell, which could potentially lead to embryo death.

Guard cells function in the regulation of stomatal pore apertures by turgor pressure changes. Obsolete guard cells have lost their functionality and are no longer capable of regulating stomatal aperture or conducting other functions of normal guard cells.\n\nGuard cells are unique in their ability to change shape and volume in response to environmental cues, such as light and moisture. In response to these cues, guard cells actively regulate the uptake and loss of water, ultimately changing the size of stomatal pores. This allows for the plant to balance the trade-off between photosynthesis and water loss, an important adaptation for survival. The ability of obsolete guard cells to undergo these changes in shape and volume is diminished, rendering them incapable of fulfilling the critical role of regulating stomatal aperture.\n\nDespite their current lack of functionality, obsolete guard cells may still provide insight into the evolution of plant anatomy and physiology.

These cells are commonly found in the phloem tissues of angiosperms, which are the plants that produce flowers and fruits. Obsolete sieve cells are called \"obsolete\" because, unlike mature sieve cells, they lack the ability to actively transport nutrients and have instead been replaced by mature cells.\n\nThe main function of obsolete sieve cells is to provide a pathway for the transport of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and hormones throughout the plant. These cells form a part of the complex network of tissues that make up the phloem. This network of tissues is responsible for the movement of nutrients from photosynthetic areas like leaves to other parts of the plant that require them, such as developing fruits.\n\nDespite their importance, obsolete sieve cells are thought to be short-lived and are eventually replaced by mature sieve cells.

Germ cells are cells that eventually differentiate into the egg and sperm cells that are necessary for sexual reproduction. Pole cells migrate along a specific pathway until they reach the female or male gonad where they will develop into germ cells. This migration is a precise process and is essential for the proper formation of the reproductive system. If the pole cells fail to migrate properly, the organism will be sterile. \n\nAside from their role in germ cell formation, pole cells also have a unique cell division process. They divide without cytokinesis, which is the process by which the cytoplasm of a cell divides into two daughter cells. Instead, the pole cells undergo an incomplete division where the nucleus divides but the cytoplasm remains undivided. This process is known as \"asymmetric division\" and is necessary for the formation of the opposite pole cell. This unique process allows for the formation of the two essential pole cells at the posterior end of the embryo.", "CL:0000302": "An obsolete IgM B cell is a type of B cell that has undergone a developmental process resulting in its inability to produce immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies.

These cells are characterized by their IgE expression and are classically associated with allergies and parasitic infections. However, recent research has shown that IgE B cells may have a more complex role in the immune system beyond just triggering allergic responses.\n\nWhen an obsolete IgE B cell encounters an allergen or parasitic antigen, it will initiate its immune response by secreting IgE antibodies. These antibodies then bind to mast cells and basophils throughout the body, activating them and leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory chemicals. This causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing. In parasitic infections, IgE antibodies can help to neutralize the parasites, preventing them from causing harm to the host.\n\nRecent studies have shown that IgE B cells may also have a role in the regulation of other immune cells.

Overall, the unique structure and function of obliquely striated muscle cells are essential for the health and well-being of the entire body.", "CL:0000737": "Striated muscle cells, also known as skeletal muscle cells, are elongated and cylindrical cells that make up the muscle tissue of the body. They are called \u201cstriated\u201d because they contain bands called \"striations,\" which give them a stripy appearance when viewed under a microscope. These muscle cells are under voluntary control and are responsible for all of the body\u2019s movements, from walking and running to lifting and throwing.\n\nStriated muscle cells are packed with contractile proteins called actin and myosin, which are arranged in a unique pattern that enables the cells to shorten and lengthen, resulting in muscle contraction. When these proteins bind together, they form cross-bridges that make the muscle cells contract. The process of contraction is initiated when an electrical impulse travels down a nerve to the muscle cell, causing calcium ions to be released, which then activate the actin and myosin proteins. This causes the muscle cells to contract, allowing movement of the associated body part.\n\nIn addition to their role in movement, striated muscle cells also have other important functions in the body. They help maintain posture and body position, regulate body temperature, and protect internal organs. These cells are also crucial for the metabolism of the body, as they require a lot of energy to function properly.

These cells are not necessarily undergoing apoptosis at the time they are classified as apoptosis fated, but they are committed to the process and will undergo programmed cell death at a specific point in time.\n\nThe process of apoptosis is crucial for maintaining healthy tissues and removing damaged or unwanted cells. Apoptosis fated cells can be found in various tissues and organs throughout the body, including the immune system, nervous system, and developing embryos. In the immune system, apoptosis plays a critical role in eliminating self-reactive immune cells and preventing autoimmunity. In the nervous system, apoptosis is involved in shaping and refining neural connections. During embryonic development, apoptosis is responsible for sculpting and remodeling developing tissues and organs.\n\nThere are several key pathways involved in regulating apoptosis, including the extrinsic pathway, which is triggered by extracellular signals, and the intrinsic pathway, which is activated by intracellular stress signals. Apoptosis fated cells have specific markers and gene expression profiles that are distinct from cells that are not undergoing apoptosis. Understanding the mechanisms and signals that control apoptosis fated cells is important for developing new therapies for diseases characterized by abnormal cell death, such as cancer.", "CL:0000446": "Chief cells are the predominant cell type of the parathyroid gland, an endocrine gland located adjacent to the thyroid gland in mammals. These cells are responsible for the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), a vital hormone in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis. Chief cells are typically large and possess a characteristic round nucleus with prominent nucleoli, as well as abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm.\n\nChief cells function to release PTH in response to low plasma calcium levels. PTH acts on the kidney, bone and intestine to regulate calcium homeostasis by increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and stimulating bone resorption, freeing calcium for use elsewhere in the body. Chief cells accomplish this through the synthesis and secretion of preproPTH, which is processed into biologically active PTH within the cell before it is released into the bloodstream.\n\nWhen PTH secretion becomes dysregulated, it can lead to disorders such as hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by increased PTH production and hypercalcemia. Conversely, hypoparathyroidism, a condition resulting from decreased PTH production or function, can lead to hypocalcemia and various symptoms such as muscle cramps and seizures. The proper function of chief cells is thus critical for the maintenance of calcium balance and overall health.", "CL:0002260": "Epithelial cells of the parathyroid gland are responsible for producing and secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). These small, bean-shaped glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland and contain two types of epithelial cells: chief cells and oxyphil cells. Chief cells are responsible for producing and secreting PTH, while oxyphil cells have an unknown function.\n\nPTH is a key regulator of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. It acts on the bones, kidneys, and intestine to increase calcium levels in the blood and decrease phosphate levels. PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bones into the bloodstream, decreases the excretion of calcium by the kidneys, and increases the absorption of calcium from the intestine. It also stimulates the excretion of phosphate by the kidneys. These actions result in an increase in serum calcium levels and a decrease in serum phosphate levels.\n\nEpithelial cells of the parathyroid gland respond to changes in serum calcium levels to regulate PTH secretion. When calcium levels are low, PTH secretion is increased, leading to an increase in serum calcium levels. When calcium levels are high, PTH secretion is decreased, leading to a decrease in serum calcium levels. This tight regulation of PTH secretion by epithelial cells of the parathyroid gland is crucial for maintaining calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body.", "CL:0000448": "White fat cells, also known as adipocytes, are specialized cells that are responsible for storing energy in the form of lipids or fat. They make up the majority of adipose tissue and are found throughout the human body, primarily in subcutaneous fat, but also in visceral fat deposits and bone marrow. White fat cells have a spherical or oval shape and contain a single, large lipid droplet that occupies most of the cell\u2019s cytoplasm.\n\nThe primary function of white fat cells is to store energy in the form of triglycerides, which are composed of fatty acids and glycerol. When an individual consumes more calories than their body needs for energy, these excess calories are stored as triglycerides in white fat cells. When energy is needed, such as during periods of fasting or physical activity, white fat cells release stored triglycerides into the bloodstream to be used by the body's tissues for energy production.\n\nWhite fat cells also play a role in regulating energy balance and metabolism by secreting hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, that signal the brain to modulate food intake and energy expenditure.

As the name suggests, preadipocytes are cells that are poised to differentiate into adipocytes, the primary cell type found in adipose tissue. These cells are commonly found in a variety of tissues throughout the body, but their presence is especially pronounced in adipose depots. \n\nPreadipocytes undergo a series of changes during the differentiation process, which results in a functional adipocyte that is essential for energy homeostasis. During this process, transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3) are induced and lead to the activation of adipogenic genes. The preadipocyte then undergoes mitotic clonal expansion, followed by the expression of genes responsible for lipid accumulation and the secretion of adipokines. The result of this process is the mature adipocyte, which is a critical component of adipose tissue function and serves to regulate whole-body metabolism.\n\nResearch has shown that preadipocytes play a crucial role in regulating adipose tissue mass and function.

They are found in small depots in the neck, clavicular, and dorsal regions of the body. Unlike white adipocytes, which primarily serve as energy storage cells, brown adipocytes are specialized in dissipating energy as heat. They do so by expressing high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a thermogenic protein that uncouples mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis, leading to the production of heat instead of ATP.\n\nBrown fat cells play a critical role in thermoregulation and energy metabolism in mammals, particularly in newborns and hibernating animals. Their thermogenic activity can increase energy expenditure and induce weight loss and improve glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, the activation or induction of brown adipose tissue has emerged as a promising strategy for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Epinephrine is a key component of the body\u2019s \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, which is activated during times of stress or danger. The hormone prepares the body for intense physical activity, increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and energy availability.\n\nChromaffin cells are unique because they receive both neural and hormonal signals. Prior to secretion, the cells are stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to release a molecule called acetylcholine, which in turn triggers the synthesis and release of epinephrine. The secretion of epinephrine is tightly regulated and dependent on the level of stimulation received by the chromaffin cells. Epinephrine release can be stimulated by physical activity, emotional stress, or injury.\n\nIn addition to their role in the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, epinephrine-secreting cells have also been implicated in a number of disease states. For example, in individuals with pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland, the cells responsible for producing epinephrine can become overactive, leading to high blood pressure and other symptoms.

These cells are part of the outermost layer of the endosperm, and their main function is to store and transport starch reserves to support the growth of the embryo during seed germination. However, in some cereal varieties, such as in modern high-yield varieties of rice, these cells have become obsolete due to genetic modifications that have changed the way starch is stored in the endosperm.\n\nThe starch sheath cells are characterized by their large, vacuolated appearance containing large amounts of starch granules, and have a role in regulating the flow of nutrients and water from the maternal plant into the embryo. In cereal grains where these cells are still present, they are known to play a crucial role in determining grain quality and yield. In particular, the amylose content of the starch stored in the starch sheath cells is used as an indicator of grain quality in many cereal crops.\n\nThe term 'obsolete' in the name of this cell type reflects its limited occurrence in modern cereal crops, and the relative lack of understanding of its full potential role in regulating endosperm development and grain quality.

These cells are located in the outermost (glomerulosa) layer of the adrenal cortex and are primarily responsible for regulating and maintaining salt and water balance in the body. Aldosterone acts on the distal tubules of the kidneys, where it increases the reabsorption of sodium ions and the excretion of potassium ions, resulting in increased blood volume and blood pressure.\n\nMC cells are stimulated to produce aldosterone by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This system is activated when blood volume or pressure is low, leading to the release of renin from the kidneys. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, into angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is found in the lungs. Angiotensin II stimulates MC cells to release aldosterone, which acts on the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption. This increases blood volume and, as a result, blood pressure.\n\nDysfunction of MC cells and aldosterone secretion can lead to various conditions such as hyperaldosteronism or hypoaldosteronism. Hyperaldosteronism is characterized by excessive aldosterone secretion, which can lead to high blood pressure, headaches, muscle weakness, and frequent urination.

These cells are responsible for producing and secreting a hormone called corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal glands to release glucocorticoids such as cortisol, a vital stress hormone.\n\nThe activity of glucocorticoid secreting cells is regulated by a complex feedback system involving the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and adrenal glands. In response to stress, the hypothalamus secretes CRH, which activates the glucocorticoid secreting cells to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then enters the bloodstream and stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and secrete glucocorticoids. Once the level of glucocorticoids in the blood reaches a certain threshold, it inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, leading to a decrease in glucocorticoid production.\n\nGlucocorticoids have many important functions in the body, including regulating metabolism, suppressing the immune system, and aiding in the body's response to stress. Dysregulation of glucocorticoid secretion can lead to a variety of disorders, such as Cushing's syndrome (characterized by an excess of glucocorticoids) or Addison's disease (characterized by a deficiency of glucocorticoids).

Juxtaglomerular cells make up around 1% of the kidney's cells and secrete the hormone renin, which plays an important role in regulating blood pressure.\n\nThe main function of the kidney granular cell is to sense changes in blood pressure and alter renin secretion in response. This occurs through a complex feedback mechanism where low blood pressure stimulates renin release from the kidney granular cells, and high blood pressure suppresses it. The renin then initiates a cascade of reactions that ultimately lead to the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that raises blood pressure.\n\nIn addition to regulating blood pressure, kidney granular cells also play a crucial role in regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, particularly in response to dehydration or low blood volume. By sensing these changes, the cells can increase the secretion of renin, which, in turn, leads to elevated levels of aldosterone and increased reabsorption of sodium and water.

CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells are primarily involved in recognizing and responding to antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, which are found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells.\n\nCD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells are known to differentiate into different subsets depending on the specific signals they receive from their environment. For example, some CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells differentiate into T helper cells, which are responsible for providing support to other immune cells by secreting cytokines. Other CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells differentiate into regulatory T cells, which help to maintain tolerance to self-antigens and prevent autoimmune disease. Additionally, some CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells differentiate into memory T cells, which provide long-lasting protection against previously encountered pathogens.\n\nThe importance of CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells in immune function is highlighted by their central role in diseases such as HIV/AIDS. HIV targets and destroys CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells, resulting in a weakened immune response and increased susceptibility to infections.

These cells are distinguished by their expression of the CD4 protein, which is a co-receptor that helps to recognize and bind to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) displaying specific peptide fragments on their surface. Once activated, they differentiate into effector cells that have the ability to secrete cytokines and chemokines, as well as to directly lyse infected or cancerous cells.\n\nOne of the primary functions of activated CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells is to help coordinate the immune response in a variety of ways. For example, they can activate other immune cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells, which can then more effectively kill infected or cancerous cells. They can also secrete cytokines that stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of B cells, which produce antibodies that help to neutralize pathogens.\n\nIn addition to their role in fighting infection and cancer, activated CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cells can also contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases if they become dysregulated.

Instead, these ex-Tregs gain effector T cell-like properties and can produce inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma and interleukin-17. \n\nDespite losing their regulatory function, ex-Tregs can still play a role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They may contribute to the perpetuation of chronic inflammation by secreting cytokines that promote survival and activation of other effector cells. In addition, it has been shown that ex-Tregs can promote tissue damage and fibrosis in models of autoimmune hepatitis and multiple sclerosis. \n\nStudies have also suggested that the development of ex-Tregs may be influenced by various factors such as the strength of T cell receptor signaling, the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and epigenetic modifications.

Many species use UV patterns or signals on their bodies to attract mates or deter rivals. UV cones allow these individuals to perceive these subtle UV signals and respond accordingly. Some studies also suggest that UV cones may play a role in regulating circadian rhythms and sleep patterns, as exposure to UV light at specific times of the day can influence these processes.", "CL:0000495": "Blue sensitive photoreceptor cells, also known as S-cones, are specialized cells in the eye that are responsible for detecting blue light. These cells are a specific type of photoreceptor located in the retina of the eye and they are critical for normal color vision. Compared to other photoreceptor cells, S-cones are relatively rare, making up only a small percentage of the photoreceptor population. Despite their rarity, these cells play a vital role in our perception of the world around us.\n\nWhen light enters the eye, it passes through several layers of cells before reaching the photoreceptors. S-cones contain special pigments that allow them to absorb blue light and convert it into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain. These signals are then transmitted through a network of cells in the retina before being sent to the brain via the optic nerve, where they are interpreted as visual information.\n\nThe function of S-cones is twofold.

These neurons are characterized by their ability to release the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has an inhibitory effect on the activity of the neurons that bind to it. Inhibitory interneurons have a wide range of functions within the nervous system, including the regulation of movement, perception, cognition, and the maintenance of homeostasis.\n\nOne of the primary functions of inhibitory interneurons is to regulate the activity of excitatory neurons within neural circuits. This is important because excitatory neurons are responsible for initiating and propagating action potentials, which can lead to overstimulation and neural damage if left unchecked. By providing inhibitory signals, inhibitory interneurons can prevent excessive activity within neural circuits, thereby maintaining a balance between excitation and inhibition. This balance is critical for the proper functioning of the nervous system, as disruptions in this balance have been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.\n\nIn addition to their role in regulating neural activity, inhibitory interneurons also play a role in a wide range of other functions within the nervous system. For example, inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord help to regulate the reflexes that govern muscle movements, while inhibitory interneurons in the visual cortex help to modulate visual processing.

The function of granulosa cells is to provide nutritional support to the developing oocyte, maintain the crucial interaction between the oocyte and the surrounding environment, and regulate the synthesis of sex steroids within the follicle.\n\nOne of the primary functions of the granulosa cells is to provide metabolic support to the oocyte. These cells are responsible for synthesizing and secreting crucial factors such as growth factors, estradiol, and inhibin that help in the development and maturation of oocyte. The granulosa cells are involved in the transport of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids from the surrounding environment into the oocyte. In addition, they also promote the formation of the zona pellucida, an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and protects it from damage.\n\nGranulosa cells also play an important role in the production of sex steroids such as estradiol, which is essential for the regulation of the menstrual cycle in women. These cells convert androgens secreted by the theca cells into estrogen via the activity of aromatase enzyme. The level of estrogen produced by the granulosa cells is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. Once the follicle reaches maturity, the high levels of estrogen produced by the granulosa cells triggers the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland, which causes ovulation.", "CL:0002174": "Follicular cells of the ovary are a type of epithelial cell that are crucial components of follicles, small sacs that contain and support developing eggs. These cells are notable for their actively proliferative and endocrine functions in the female reproductive system. Follicular cells surround and support the egg in the follicle, providing both nutrients and structural support as it develops. While the follicle is still maturing in the ovary, the follicular cells secrete estrogen, the primary female hormone, in order to help regulate the menstrual cycle and maintain pregnancy. \n\nIn addition to their support of the egg, follicular cells are involved in the formation of the corpus luteum. After an egg is released, the follicular cells remaining in the ovary form a structure called the corpus luteum. This structure secretes progesterone, another important female hormone, which prepares the uterus for pregnancy and helps maintain it during early development of the fetus. Follicular cells of the ovary are also involved in the process of ovulation itself. In response to hormonal signals, the follicular cells detach from the egg and the ovary, allowing the mature egg to be released into the fallopian tube where it can potentially be fertilized by sperm. \n\nOverall, follicular cells of the ovary are essential for the development and viability of eggs in the female reproductive system.

These cells play an essential role in the regulation of ovarian follicle development and secretion of sex steroids. The theca cells are classified into two types, theca interna and theca externa. The theca interna is a more hormone-producing part of the theca cells, whereas theca externa is a more connective tissue-like layer.\n\nThe theca cells secrete androgens, primarily androstenedione, which is converted to estradiol by granulosa cells. Androgens secreted by theca cells are vital for follicular development and maturation. The differentiation of the theca cells is regulated by the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. This hormone stimulates the secretion of androgens by theca cells, promoting ovarian follicle growth and follicular fluid production.\n\nFurthermore, the theca cells have a significant influence on the onset of puberty and the maintenance of the menstrual cycle. In pre-pubescent females, theca cells are not active, leading to an absence of androgen secretion. Puberty onset results in activation of the theca cells, accompanied by an increase in androgen secretion. In conjunction with the granulosa cells, theca cells help to generate regular menstrual cycles in adult females. Theca cells are therefore a crucial component in female fertility and hormonal regulation.", "CL:0000593": "Androgen-secreting cells, also known as Leydig cells, are endocrine cells located in the interstitial tissue of the testes. These cells are responsible for the production and secretion of testosterone, the male sex hormone. Testosterone plays an important role in the development of male reproductive organs and sex characteristics, sperm production, and the regulation of sexual behavior. Androgen-secreting cells are also found in the ovaries of females, but to a much lesser extent than in males.\n\nThe secretion of testosterone by androgen-secreting cells is regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) secreted by the pituitary gland. When LH binds to receptors on the surface of Leydig cells, it stimulates the production and release of testosterone into the bloodstream. In turn, testosterone negatively regulates the secretion of LH, creating a negative feedback loop to maintain appropriate levels of testosterone in the body.\n\nChanges in the function of androgen-secreting cells can lead to various disorders, including hypogonadism, infertility, and certain types of cancer. In hypogonadism, there is a decrease in the production of testosterone, leading to reduced sexual development and function. In some cases, there can also be an increase in the secretion of testosterone, leading to conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome in females and prostate cancer in males.

They are responsible for producing and secreting histamine, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. ECL cells have a distinct morphology characterized by large granules, which contain histamine and can be easily visualized using histological techniques.\n\nThe primary function of ECL cells is to modulate gastric acid secretion in response to various stimuli. When the stomach is stimulated by food, the mucosa releases gastrin, a hormone that binds to receptors on ECL cells. This binding results in the activation of a signaling cascade that ultimately leads to the release of histamine from the granules of ECL cells. Histamine then binds to H2 receptors on the parietal cells, which are responsible for secreting hydrochloric acid into the stomach lumen, stimulating their secretion of acid. The increased acidity in turn activates pepsinogen, which is produced by chief cells and cleaved to produce pepsin. This process ultimately leads to the breakdown of food in the stomach.\n\nIn addition to their role in gastric acid secretion, ECL cells also play a role in the regulation of gastric motility. Histamine released from ECL cells acts on smooth muscle cells in the stomach to promote contraction and motility. The role of this process is to mix and digest the food more efficiently, setting the stage for further processing of nutrients and energy release downstream.

Beyond pain modulation, enkephalin has been implicated in other physiological processes such as the regulation of reward pathways and the stress response. In addition, enkephalin-secreting cells appear to be involved in the regulation of mood, as seen in the association between opioid systems and depression.\n\nEnkephalin-secreting cells are also thought to play a role in stress-induced analgesia, where exposure to stressors can result in decreased sensitivity to painful stimuli. This effect is believed to be mediated by the release of enkephalin from enkephalin-secreting cells. Enkephalin is also involved in modulating the effects of other neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin, which have important roles in reward processing and mood regulation.

Therefore, understanding the function and differentiation of basophilic erythroblasts is essential for understanding the process of erythropoiesis and its role in maintaining homeostasis within the body.", "CL:0000765": "Erythroblasts are a critical type of cell responsible for producing red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen throughout the body. These cells are found in the bone marrow and are distinguished by their large size and abundance of cytoplasm. As they mature, erythroblasts undergo several stages of differentiation, culminating in the production of reticulocytes that eventually become mature red blood cells.\n\nAt each stage of their development, erythroblasts undergo various changes that are necessary for their ultimate function. During the earliest stages of differentiation, erythroblasts contain a large nucleus that eventually shrinks as the cell matures. They also undergo changes in the types of proteins and enzymes in their cytoplasm that facilitate the production of hemoglobin. Later on in their development, erythroblasts begin to shrink and condense as they release their nucleus, finishing the process of becoming fully mature red blood cells.\n\nOverall, erythroblasts play a critical role in the body's ability to transport oxygen through the bloodstream. By producing red blood cells, they help to ensure that the body's tissues and organs receive the oxygen they need to function properly. While erythroblasts are relatively short-lived, their importance in the production of red blood cells makes them essential to human health.", "CL:0000550": "Polychromatophilic erythroblasts are a type of erythroblast, which is a precursor cell of red blood cells. These cells are found in the bone marrow and play a crucial role in the production of red blood cells. Erythroblasts are characterized by their ability to divide and differentiate into mature red blood cells, which are responsible for carrying oxygen to all parts of the body.\n\nPolychromatophilic erythroblasts are so named because of their unique appearance under a microscope. They are larger than earlier stage erythroblasts and are characterized by their gray-blue color. These cells have a nucleus and are actively synthesizing hemoglobin, the protein responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells. As the polychromatophilic erythroblast matures, the amount of hemoglobin in the cell increases, causing it to become more red in color.\n\nThe primary function of polychromatophilic erythroblasts is to produce mature red blood cells. These cells go through several stages of development, including the polychromatophilic erythroblast stage. During this stage, the cell begins to synthesize hemoglobin and lose its nucleus. The end result is a mature red blood cell that is able to transport oxygen to all parts of the body. Without a sufficient number of polychromatophilic erythroblasts, the body would not be able to produce enough red blood cells, leading to a condition called anemia.", "CL:0017504": "Polychromatophilic cytoplasm is a term used in hematopoiesis to describe the immature erythrocytes, known as reticulocytes. Reticulocytes are erythrocytes that have been released from the bone marrow into the bloodstream and are in the process of maturing into fully functional erythrocytes. The term \"polychromatophilic cytoplasm\" refers to the cytoplasmic characteristic of reticulocytes, which has a blue-gray hue when stained with certain laboratory dyes, as opposed to mature erythrocytes, which have a reddish hue.\n\nThe polychromatophilic cytoplasm of reticulocytes is indicative of the high level of protein synthesis occurring during erythropoiesis. In order to produce functional erythrocytes capable of transporting oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues, reticulocytes increase the synthesis of hemoglobin and other essential proteins needed by the cell. This increase in protein synthesis is reflected in the appearance of the polychromatophilic cytoplasm, which can be observed under a microscope. As reticulocytes mature, the polychromatophilic cytoplasm becomes less apparent, and the cell takes on the typical biconcave shape of mature erythrocytes.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of reticulocytes with polychromatophilic cytoplasm is commonly used as an indicator of erythropoietic activity in the body. Elevated levels of reticulocytes with polychromatophilic cytoplasm in the blood can be a sign of increased erythropoietic activity in response to anemia or other conditions that cause a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity. Therefore, the study of polychromatophilic cytoplasm and reticulocytes is important in the diagnosis and management of blood disorders.", "CL:0000551": "Unimodal nociceptors are sensory neurons that respond specifically to noxious stimuli, such as intense heat, cold, mechanical pressure, or chemical irritants. These neurons are part of the somatosensory system, which conveys information about the external and internal environment to the central nervous system, allowing for the perception and interpretation of touch, pain, temperature, and other sensory modalities. Unimodal nociceptors are named so because they respond to a specific type of stimulus and do not respond to other types of sensory input.\n\nUnimodal nociceptors are characterized by their small size, unmyelinated or lightly myelinated axons, and slow conduction velocity. They are located in the skin, mucous membranes, and connective tissues, where they detect tissue damage or inflammation and transmit signals to the spinal cord and brainstem. In the dorsal root ganglion, unimodal nociceptors express specific receptors and ion channels that allow them to detect and respond to different types of noxious stimuli. For example, some nociceptors express transient receptor potential (TRP) channels that are activated by heat, acid, or capsaicin, while others express purinergic receptors that are activated by ATP released from damaged cells.\n\nWhen unimodal nociceptors are activated, they release neurotransmitters such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and glutamate, which sensitize and activate second-order neurons in the spinal cord. This leads to the perception of pain and the initiation of protective reflexes, such as withdrawal or escape responses. Unimodal nociceptors play a crucial role in the detection and avoidance of potentially harmful stimuli, but their hyperactivation or dysfunction can lead to chronic pain and pathological conditions, such as neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and inflammatory diseases.

These cells are highly specialized in their function of producing functional red blood cells, specifically in the process of hemoglobin production and degradation. As the orthochromatic erythroblast nears the final stage of its maturation, it ejects its nucleus from the cell and fills with hemoglobin, assuming its characteristic biconcave shape.\n\nDuring the process of erythropoiesis, orthochromatic erythroblasts are preceded by more immature erythroblasts that continually differentiate and divide to produce these specialized cells. The orthochromatic erythroblast is the last stage of erythropoiesis before the cell is released into circulation as a red blood cell. Any abnormalities or defects at this stage of erythropoiesis can lead to the production of immature red blood cells, which can impact oxygen transport and lead to various anemias.\n\nIn addition to their importance in the production of red blood cells, orthochromatic erythroblasts have been shown to have the ability to promote immune tolerance. These cells produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and display self-antigens, which can help prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own cells. This unique function highlights the diversity of roles that different cell types can fulfill within the body, and underscores the importance of understanding the biology of these cells in both health and disease.", "CL:0017502": "Cells have a variety of distinct features, including the composition of their cytoplasm. Some cells have acidophilic cytoplasm, which can be identified by its pink or reddish appearance when stained with certain dyes. The acidic nature of these cells is due to the high concentration of acidic organelles such as lysosomes and secretory vesicles. Acidophilic cells serve a variety of functions, including digestion, hormone secretion, and immune response.\n\nOne of the primary functions of acidophilic cells is digestion. Cells in the stomach, for example, have highly acidophilic cytoplasm that aids in the breakdown of food. The acidic environment allows enzymes to function properly, breaking down proteins and other molecules into smaller components that can be absorbed by the body. Similarly, cells in the pancreas and intestinal lining have acidophilic cytoplasm that helps with the secretion of digestive enzymes.\n\nAnother important function of acidophilic cells is hormone secretion. Cells in the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and adrenal glands all have acidophilic cytoplasm and play important roles in regulating various physiological processes. For example, acidophilic cells in the pituitary gland produce growth hormone, which is essential for proper growth and development. Cells in the thyroid gland produce thyroid hormone, which helps regulate metabolism and energy production.\n\nFinally, acidophilic cells are also involved in the immune response. Cells in the immune system, such as eosinophils, have acidophilic cytoplasm that helps them attack and destroy invading pathogens.

These megakaryocytes then produce and release platelets, which circulate in the blood and are involved in hemostasis and wound healing.\n\nMegakaryocyte progenitor cells are regulated by various factors, including cytokines such as thrombopoietin and interleukin-11. These cytokines stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocyte progenitor cells and promote megakaryocyte maturation, ultimately leading to increased platelet production. Megakaryocyte progenitor cells have also been found to play a role in immune regulation, with some studies suggesting that they may have a role in modulating inflammatory responses and regulating immune cell function.\n\nOverall, megakaryocyte progenitor cells are critical for maintaining normal blood clotting and wound healing, and dysregulation of their function can lead to disorders such as thrombocytopenia and thrombocythemia.

Neuronal brush cells have microvilli projections on their apical surface, giving them a \"brush-like\" appearance. These cells play a key role in chemosensation and are thought to be involved in both detecting and responding to chemical stimuli.\n\nNeuronal brush cells are unique in their ability to chemically sense the environment. When chemical compounds come into contact with the microvilli, they are detected by the sensory receptors located there. This detection triggers a nerve impulse, which is then transmitted to other parts of the body. In the respiratory tract, neuronal brush cells are associated with detecting harmful substances such as allergens and pollutants. In the gastrointestinal tract, they are thought to play a role in signaling responses to nutrients and metabolic activity.\n\nIn addition to their chemosensory role, recent research has suggested that neuronal brush cells may also play a role in immune function.

These cells are found in the inner ear, specifically in the cochlea, a coiled, snail-shaped structure that is responsible for detecting sound waves and converting them into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. Cochlear inner hair cells play a crucial role in this process by amplifying and encoding sound signals.\n\nCochlear inner hair cells are characterized by the presence of stereocilia, which are hair-like projections that protrude from the apical surface of the cell. These stereocilia are arranged in a precise pattern and are connected by tip links, which are protein structures that allow for mechanical movement of the stereocilia. When sound waves enter the cochlea, they cause movement of the stereocilia, which in turn opens ion channels and triggers the release of neurotransmitters. This process generates electrical impulses that are sent to the brain via the auditory nerve.\n\nLoss or damage to cochlear inner hair cells can result in hearing loss or deafness.

They are typically dispersed by wind or water, allowing the fungi to reproduce and colonize new habitats. In some species, the basidiospores may also be consumed by animals or insects, facilitating their dispersal.\n\nBasidiospores have a unique morphology, consisting of a single cell with a thick cell wall and two distinct regions: the apical cell and the basal cell. The apical cell contains the spore nucleus and various organelles, while the basal cell is specialized for attachment and germination. In some species, the basal cell may also contain nutrient reserves that support the development of the germinating spore.

These spores were once used as a taxonomic feature to differentiate between Mucorales species, but they are no longer considered relevant due to advances in DNA sequencing technology. The term \"obsolete\" refers to the fact that this feature is no longer used in modern taxonomy.\n\nSporangiospores are formed within sporangia, which are specialized structures that form on the ends of sporangiophores. These structures are especially important for the dispersal of fungi, as the spores they contain can be transported long distances by air currents. Once the spores land in a suitable environment, they can germinate and give rise to new fungal colonies.\n\nIn terms of function, the production of sporangiospores allows fungi in the Mucorales order to reproduce asexually.

These unicellular spores were highly motile and could swim through water with the help of one or more flagella. Once they encountered a suitable substrate, they would settle down and begin to grow into a new individual.\n\nThe zoospore was an important adaptation that allowed some organisms to disperse their genetic material over long distances, especially in aquatic environments where it is difficult for non-motile cells to move around. The flagella served as a mode of locomotion that let the zoospore swim towards nutrient-rich areas, or towards other cells in order to mate and exchange genetic material. Once this happened, the zoospore would settle down and begin to divide and grow into a new organism.\n\nNowadays, the term \"obsolete zoospore\" is used to describe a type of spore that is no longer used for reproduction in modern organisms. This is because most organisms have evolved more efficient methods of reproduction that do not require motile spores.

Mast cells are unique in that they are equipped with specialized granules that contain a range of potent biochemicals, including histamine, cytokines, and chemokines, that can be rapidly released in response to certain stimuli.\n\nThe primary function of mast cells is to detect and respond to foreign invaders and tissue damage. When mast cells encounter an allergen or pathogen, they become activated and release their granules, which trigger a cascade of immune responses. Histamine, for example, causes blood vessel dilation and increased blood flow to the site of infection or injury, which helps to bring immune cells and other protective molecules to the area. Mast cells also release cytokines and chemokines, which attract other immune cells to help clear the infection or remove damaged tissue. Additionally, mast cells have been shown to be involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration.\n\nWhile mast cells are vital for immune defense, they can also contribute to the development of certain diseases, such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disorders. In these conditions, mast cells can become overactive and release too many granules, leading to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that control mast cell activation and regulation is therefore an active area of research in the field of immunology and holds promise for the development of new treatments for diseases associated with mast cell dysfunction.", "CL:0000813": "Memory T cells are an essential component of the adaptive immune system that play a crucial role in providing long-term immunity to infectious agents. These cells are a subset of T lymphocytes and are generated following an initial response to an antigenic stimulus. Upon activation, memory T cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and differentiate into long-lived populations of memory cells that persist for years or decades in the host.\n\nMemory T cells are known for their capacity to recognize and respond rapidly to antigens that have previously been encountered. These cells possess a unique repertoire of cell surface markers and cytokine receptors that enable them to distinguish between self and non-self and to selectively target infected or abnormal cells. Upon encountering a specific antigen, memory T cells differentiate into effector cells that produce a range of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules that eliminate the antigenic threat.\n\nIn conclusion, memory T cells are a critical component of the immune response and play a key role in maintaining long-term immunity to pathogens. These cells possess a potent ability to combat infectious agents through their rapid and targeted response to previously encountered antigens. The study of memory T cells has important implications for the development of vaccines and therapies for diseases that have a strong immunological component.", "CL:0000898": "Naive T cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that have not yet encountered their cognate antigen or been activated by cytokines. They are called \"naive\" because they have not yet been exposed to the antigens that activate mature T cells into effector cells or memory cells. As a result of lacking prior exposure to antigens, naive T cells have relatively poor effector functions and are present in an immunologically quiescent state.\n\nNaive T cells primarily reside in the secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. These cells constantly recirculate in the blood and lymphatics until they recognize a specific antigen presented on the surface of a professional antigen-presenting cell. After activation, naive T cells differentiate into effector T cells or memory T cells, depending on the type of antigen and the cytokine milieu.\n\nNaive T cells play a critical role in adaptive immunity by continuously replenishing the pool of mature T cells in the body. Although they do not have full effector functions, the presence of naive T cells in the circulation is essential for mounting effective immune responses against new infections or tumors. The decline of naive T cells with aging, which is called immunosenescence, is a contributing factor to the higher incidence of infectious diseases, reduced vaccine efficacy, and increased cancer mortality observed in older individuals.", "CL:0000814": "Mature NK T cells, also known as natural killer T cells, are a type of lymphocyte that plays a crucial role in the immune response. These cells are characterized by the expression of both T cell receptors (TCRs) and NK receptors on their surface.

During their differentiation, pro-B cells undergo several rounds of cell division, rearrange their immunoglobulin genes to generate a diverse repertoire of B cell receptors, and undergo selection processes to ensure the proper function of their receptors. Once they have matured, B cells can differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, or memory B cells that provide long-term protection against future infections.\n\nPro-B cells are essential for the development of the adaptive immune system and the generation of a diverse repertoire of B cells with specific antibody receptors.

Additionally, B-1 B cells have been implicated in the control of inflammation, as they can secrete anti-inflammatory factors that limit the extent of tissue damage in various pathological conditions. \n\nImportantly, B-1 B cells have been shown to be involved in the development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a cancer of the B cell lineage. Although the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not fully understood, it is thought that the accumulation of B-1 B cells in the body may contribute to the onset and progression of CLL. Therefore, further studies on B-1 B cells may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of CLL and lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this disease.", "CL:0000820": "B-1a B cells are a subset of B lymphocytes that are prominent in the peritoneal and pleural cavities and are responsible for natural antibody production.

These cells are distinct from other B cell types due to their ability to secrete natural antibodies and their capacity for self-renewal. The primary function of B-1b B cells is to provide immediate protection against infection by synthesizing low-affinity natural IgM antibodies. B-1b B cells are also involved in the production of regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, that promote immune tolerance.\n\nThe natural antibodies secreted by B-1b B cells have a broad spectrum of activity and can recognize and neutralize a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These antibodies are generated without prior exposure to the antigen and do not require the assistance of T cells or the germinal center reaction. As a result, the response time is much faster, which allows the B-1b B cells to provide immediate protection against invading pathogens.\n\nB-1b B cells are also crucial for maintaining peripheral tolerance, a process that prevents the immune system from attacking self-antigens. They secrete regulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, which promote the generation of regulatory T cells that dampen the response of other immune cells to self-antigens.

B-2 B cells also have the ability to differentiate into memory cells, which allow for a more rapid and efficient immune response if the same antigen is encountered again in the future.\n\nB-2 B cells are important in defending the body against pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and play a key role in protecting against infectious diseases. However, these cells can also malfunction and contribute to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, by producing antibodies that target the body's own tissues.

Immature ILCs are found in various tissues, including the bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, tonsils, and intestines.\n\nThe function of immature ILCs is not fully understood, but they are thought to serve as precursor cells that give rise to different subsets of mature ILCs in response to environmental cues. For example, ILCs in the gut undergo a process of differentiation that is driven by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-15, as well as by interactions with other cells in the gut, such as epithelial cells and dendritic cells. This process leads to the development of mature ILC3s, which produce the cytokine IL-22 and are crucial for the maintenance of the gut barrier and the defense against enteric pathogens.

This process involves somatic rearrangement of the genes that encode these proteins, resulting in a vast repertoire of immunoglobulin molecules capable of recognizing a wide variety of antigens. Large pre-B-II cells undergo V(D)J recombination of the heavy chain genes, followed by proliferation and differentiation into small pre-B cells, which undergo V(D)J recombination of the light chain genes.

The absence of the pre-BCR marks these cells as being in the late stages of the pre-B II developmental stage.\n\nThese cells comprise a critical intermediate stage in the development of functional B cells. PreBCR-negative large pre-B-II cells are the last point in B cell development where genetic rearrangements of the antibody heavy and light chain loci can occur before the selection process occurs.

ICC are also involved in signal transduction between enteric nerve cells and smooth muscle cells, and may contribute to the regulation of motility and secretion in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nICC are identified by their unique morphology, which includes a spindle-shaped cell body with long processes that form a network of interconnected cells within the gut wall. This network of cells extends along the length of the gastrointestinal tract, from the esophagus to the anus, and is organized into distinct subtypes that are specialized for different regions of the gut. The pacemaker activity of ICC is thought to be due to specialized ion channels and non-selective cation channels that are highly expressed within these cells. These channels generate pacemaker potentials that trigger rhythmic depolarization and contraction of the surrounding smooth muscle cells.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that ICC may also play a role in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastroparesis, and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP). Alterations in ICC number, morphology, and function have been reported in these conditions, and may contribute to the abnormal motility patterns and symptoms associated with these disorders.

Specifically, polar bodies are formed when oocytes divide asymmetrically during meiosis I and II in order to produce a single large ovum for fertilization. As a result of this process, up to three polar bodies may be produced, with the second polar body potentially dividing into two additional polar bodies. Unlike oocytes, polar bodies are not capable of fertilization and typically undergo rapid degeneration. \n\nThe main function of polar bodies is to facilitate the production of a healthy, genetically diverse offspring. By dividing the cytoplasm of the oocyte into a large, mature ovum and multiple smaller polar bodies, the majority of the genetic material and organelles are concentrated in the egg, which is then capable of being fertilized. Additionally, the production of polar bodies serves to remove any excess genetic material, which can lead to chromosomal abnormalities and developmental defects. While polar bodies have traditionally been viewed as non-functional cells, recent studies suggest that they may also play a role in regulating gene expression and contributing to genetic diversity. \n\nIn some cases, abnormalities in polar body formation can lead to infertility, miscarriage, or genetic disorders in offspring. By studying the mechanisms of polar body formation, researchers hope to develop new strategies for improving assisted reproductive techniques and preventing these conditions.

This cell is a result of the asymmetric division of the oocyte that occurs after it is fertilized, and its primary function is to ensure the proper distribution of genetic material to the developing embryo. \n\nDuring fertilization, the oocyte completes its first meiotic division, producing a primary polar body that contains half of the genetic material. The primary polar body then undergoes a second meiotic division, producing two secondary polar bodies. These polar bodies do not contribute to the development of the embryo but instead degenerate shortly after formation.\n\nThe formation of primary polar bodies is crucial for the maintenance of the correct chromosome number in the developing embryo. Without this process, the embryo would have an incorrect number of chromosomes, which could lead to developmental abnormalities. Additionally, the formation of polar bodies ensures that the maternal contribution of genetic material is balanced with the paternal contribution, which is important for proper embryonic development.

In female organisms, meiosis results in the production of one ovum and two or three small polar bodies. The secondary polar body is the second of the small polar bodies, produced after the first polar body. The formation of polar bodies is a necessary process that ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. Without the formation of polar bodies, the chromosome number in the offspring would be incorrect, leading to genetic abnormalities.\n\nThe Function of the secondary polar body is to discard redundant DNA and extra proteins that results from meiosis. During meiosis, the primary oocyte divides into two daughter cells \u2013 one containing most of the cytoplasm and organelles, which becomes the secondary oocyte, and the other smaller cell is the first polar body. The secondary oocyte will later divide again to produce the mature ovum and the second polar body.

Cortical cells are the primary cells of the adrenal cortex and are responsible for the production and secretion of these hormones.\n\nThere are three subtypes of cortical cells in the adrenal cortex, including zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Each subtype is responsible for producing different hormones. The zona glomerulosa produces aldosterone, which is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The zona fasciculata produces cortisol, which plays a key role in the body's stress response and helps to regulate metabolism. The zona reticularis produces androgens, which are hormones that are involved in the development of male sexual characteristics.\n\nIn addition to their role in hormone production, cortical cells of the adrenal gland also play a role in the body's response to stress. When the body is under stress, the hypothalamus in the brain releases a hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates cortical cells of the adrenal gland to produce and secrete cortisol and other hormones, which help the body to respond to the stressor. Overall, cortical cells of the adrenal gland are critical for regulating many important functions within the body and play a key role in the body's response to stress.", "CL:1001601": "Adrenal gland glandular cells, also known as adrenal cortex cells or adrenocortical cells, are the main functional cells of the adrenal cortex.

These cells are long, cylindrical, and multinucleated, with their nuclei arranged peripherally. Somatic muscle cells are highly organized and striated due to the presence of myofibrils, which are composed of thick and thin filaments of protein. These filaments work together in a contracting and relaxing fashion to generate force and movement.\n\nSomatic muscle cells work together with the nervous system to produce movement in response to conscious or unconscious signals.
