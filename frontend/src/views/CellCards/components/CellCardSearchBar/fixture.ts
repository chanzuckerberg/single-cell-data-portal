    "Luminal cells of prostate epithelium are a type of epithelial cell that line the prostate gland ducts. These cells are responsible for producing and secreting prostate fluid, which helps to nourish and protect sperm. They are characterized by their tall, columnar shape and the presence of secretory granules within their cytoplasm. Luminal cells also express androgen receptors, allowing them to respond to hormonal signals from the body. Dysfunction or changes in the number of luminal cells may contribute to prostate diseases such as prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

    "Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that are responsible for bone resorption in the body. They are large cells that are formed from the fusion of monocytes, a type of white blood cell, and are found on the surface of bones. Osteoclasts secrete acid and enzymes that break down the mineralized matrix of bone tissue. They play a crucial role in the maintenance of bone tissue and the regulation of calcium levels in the body. Dysfunction of osteoclasts can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis.",

    "Intestinal epithelial cells are responsible for the absorption of nutrients and water from the lumen of the intestine into the bloodstream. These cells also act as a barrier, preventing harmful substances and microorganisms from passing through the intestinal wall and into the body. Intestinal epithelial cells are continuously renewed throughout an individual's life and play a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis. Dysfunction of these cells has been associated with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders.",
  "CL:0000066":
    "Epithelial cells are cells that line the surfaces of organs and tissues in the body. They serve as a protective barrier, regulating the exchange of substances between the body and the environment. Epithelial cells also play important roles in secretion, absorption and sensing stimuli. They come in different shapes and sizes depending on their location and function, and can form different types of tissues such as glandular tissue or the lining of the digestive tract.",
  "CL:1000272":
    "A lung secretory cell is a cell type that is responsible for secreting mucus, surfactant proteins, and other substances that keep the lungs moist and protected from harmful particles and microorganisms. These cells are found throughout the respiratory tract and are essential for proper lung function.",
  "CL:0000183":
    "A contractile cell is a cell type that is capable of generating tension and contracting. This process is achieved through the sliding of actin and myosin filaments in response to signaling pathways. Contractile cells are found in various tissues and organs, including muscle, blood vessels, and the heart, where they play a key role in regulating blood flow and organ function.",
