        After filtering cells with low coverage (less than 500 genes expressed),
        gene counts are normalized independently for each cell by converting
        counts to quantiles and obtaining the corresponding values from a normal
        distribution. Then normalized cell vectors are concatenated along the
        gene axis. The algorithm is summarized in detail in{" "}
