  The cellxgene Data Portal was recently migrated to an enhanced schema to 
  optimize reusability. The cellxgene team is still migrating a small subset 
  of genes with complex mappings to GENCODE 38, the human gene reference 
  required by the schema. As a result, more genes may be added in the coming 
  weeks. The current data can be used with confidence that the genes that are 
  present are correctly mapped.
