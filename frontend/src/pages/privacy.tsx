              <p>
                Cellxgene is a tool that enables fast visualizations of curated
                single-cell transcriptomics datasets. It takes data submitted by
                researchers (<em>gene expression matrices</em> that indicate
                counts of how often genes are expressed in certain cell types
                and <em>metadata</em> detailing how those matrices were
                generated) and helps you visualize it for faster analysis,
                exploration, and – hopefully – insight.
              </p>
