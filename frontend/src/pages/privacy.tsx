              We are a site for biologists, computational researchers, and
              others (collectively, “<strong>Visitors</strong>” or “
              <strong>you</strong>

                <h3>Data We Collect</h3>
                <p>
                  Cellxgene is a tool that enables fast visualizations of
                  curated single-cell transcriptomics datasets. It takes data
                  submitted by researchers (<em>gene expression matrices</em>{" "}
                  that indicate counts of how often genes are expressed in
                  certain cell types and <em>metadata</em> detailing how those
                  matrices were generated) and helps you visualize it for faster
                  analysis, exploration, and – hopefully – insight.
                </p>

                    <h4>Data You Provide To Us.</h4> We collect certain

                    Specifically, this includes data you submit for display in
                    cellxgene (ex: single-cell .h5ad matrix files), data you
                    provide you us as part of submission or registering for an
                    account (ex: name and email address), as well as if you
                    contact us for support or with information about a dataset
                    via email. This information is necessary in order to create

                          certain information automatically and store it in log
