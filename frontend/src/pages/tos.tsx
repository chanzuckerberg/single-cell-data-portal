            These Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) apply to everyone
            who accesses and uses the version of CELLxGENE located at

          <p>
            The purpose of the Site is to provide a version of the interactive
            data explorer called CELLxGENE that enables fast visualizations of
            curated single-cell transcriptomics datasets (those datasets, the “
            <strong>Data</strong>”). By leveraging modern web development
            techniques to enable those visualizations, we hope to enable
            biologists and computational researchers to explore that Data.

                  exclusive, final and binding means of initiating adversarial
                  proceedings, you agree that it be resolved fully and finally
                  by neutral and binding arbitration administered by JAMS in San
                  Mateo County, California, in accordance with its Streamlined
                  Arbitration Rules & Procedures, the Federal Arbitration Act,
                  and the substantive laws of the State of California, exclusive
                  of conflict or choice of law rules. In-person proceedings will

                  and documented travel expenses will be paid by CZIF. The

                  that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction
                  and will issue a written decision at the end of the

                  without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that
                  require the application of the law of a different state.
                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent such laws are
                  inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, the Federal
                  Arbitration Act will govern. Any dispute that is not subject
                  to arbitration (e.g., if arbitration is deemed unenforceable
                  or inapplicable) shall be, and any judgement on any
                  arbitration award may be, brought in the U.S. District Court
                  for the Northern District of California or a state court
