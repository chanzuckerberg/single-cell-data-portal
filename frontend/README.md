# Data Portal Front End

## Development

See [DEV_ENV.md](DEV_ENV.md) for local dev quickstart

NOTE: If you want to `npm i` in your local machine, please make sure to install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), since we use `.nvmrc` to specify which node version to install the dependencies

## Environment Variables

The environment variables for the web application. The variables are stored in /frontend/configs/\*. E.g., `frontend/configs/local.js`

For local development, please copy `local.js` to a new file named `configs.js`
in the same directory (`frontend/configs/configs.js`)

WARNING: Do not store sensitive data in the environment variables.

| Name            | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| AUTH0_DOMAIN    | The hosted Auth0 domain used for Authentication      |
| AUTH0_CLIENT_ID | The client id of the Auth0 application for this site |
| AUDIENCE        | The domain of the corpora api                        |
| API_URL         | The URL to the corpora api                           |

## Deployment

1. Ensure your `awscli` is configured with the
   [required credentials and profiles](../docs/awscli.md).
   Set the appropriate `AWS_PROFILE`.

   ```shell
   export AWS_PROFILE=single-cell-dev
   ```

1. **Specify deployment.**

   Set the `DEPLOYMENT_STAGE` environment variable to a valid deployed environment: `test`, `staging`

   ```shell
   export DEPLOYMENT_STAGE=test
   ```

1. **Deploy.**

   Files are deployed to a publicly accessible bucket. Do not include sensitive data in the deployed files.

   ```shell
   make deploy
   ```

## Smoke Test

### If you are actively adding/updating tests

When we add/update tests, we typically want an FE server running constantly,
so we can see our code changes reflected in the UI as quickly as possible.

As a result, [Gatsby Dev Build](#gatsby-dev-build) steps allow you to run smoke
tests against the already running FE server in dev mode. This is different from [If you just want to run smoke tests](#if-you-just-want-to-run-smoke-tests), which starts the FE server for you before the test and shuts it down after the test is done.

[Gatsby Prod Build](#gatsby-prod-build) builds the app in prod mode, which includes
various optimizations and Server Side Rendering.

The upside of running prod build
is that the experience is closer to what real users get, the downside is that
it takes longer to build the app and run the tests.

As a result, PR test runs
prod build smoke test for you as a guard to prevent us from shipping things that
work in dev build, but not prod build.

#### Gatsby Dev Build

Start an FE server in dev mode and run smoke test against it

1. Start FE server: `npm run develop`

1. Run tests: `npm run e2e`

#### Gatsby Prod Build

Start an FE server in prod mode and run smoke test against it

1. Start FE server: `npm run build-and-start-prod`

1. Run tests: `npm run e2e-localProd`

NOTE: `npm run smoke-test-prod-build` combines the steps above

### If you just want to run smoke tests

If you don't have an FE server running already and want the command to start one for you for the duration of the smoke tests, the commands below will do that for you.

#### FE + Dev BE

This starts an FE server that hits **dev environment** API server

1. Requirements:

   1. Your `src/configs/configs.js` points to Dev API URL instead of `localhost`.

      E.g., `https://api.dev.corpora.cziscience.com` (FIXME mbarrien)

1. For Gatsby Prod Build: `npm run smoke-test-prod-build`

1. For Gatsby Dev Build: `npm run smoke-test`

#### FE + Local BE

This starts an FE server that hits a **local** API server

1. Requirements:

   1. You are able to spin up a local BE server
   1. Your `src/configs/configs.js` points to local BE server. E.g., `http://backend.corporanet.local:5000`

1. For Gatsby Prod Build: `npm run smoke-test-with-local-backend`

### CI/CD

These are the commands we integrate in CI/CD pipeline for PR tests and
after deployment tests

1. Staging: `npm run e2e-staging`
1. Prod: `npm run e2e-prod`

## üßê What's inside

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
