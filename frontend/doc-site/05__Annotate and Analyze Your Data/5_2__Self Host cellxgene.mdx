# Self-Host CellxGene

## Hosting CellxGene Desktop on the Web

Cellxgene desktop is intended to be used by researchers on their local machines. In cases where collaborators are not comfortable installing cellxgene, it is possible to host cellxgene, so your collaborators only need to open the URL you send them.

We don't officially support web deployment, but we've offered some guidance in the following sections on ways to deploy cellxgene to the web.

## General Notes and Cautions

Please consider the following when deploying cellxgene in any "hosted" environment, especially where access from the broader Internet is possible:

- Information security requires careful configuration of the host environment, including firewall, logging, etc - please follow best practices
- Cellxgene includes features which may be inappropriate for a hosted deployment - you may wish to use the following command line option:` `--disable-diffexp``
- `cellxgene launch` currently uses Flask's development server, which is not recommended for hosted deployment (see [the Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/deploy/#run-with-a-production-server))
- We have no testing or official support for deployments where multiple users are accessing the same cellxgene instance
- Your cellxgene instance is likely to hang or crash if too many people access it at the same time, especially if they using functions that call the Python backend (such as differential expression, noted above)
- Cellxgene only supports one instance per dataset

If you believe you have found a security-related issue with cellxgene, please report the issue immediately to [[security@chanzuckerberg.com](security@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:security@chanzuckerberg.com)]

## Configuration Options

The following configuration options require special consideration in any multi-user or hosted environment:

`--disable-diffexp`: the differential expression computation can be resource intensive, in particular for large datasets. If many differential expression calculation requests are made in rapid sequence, it may cause the server CPU or memory resources to be exhausted, and impact the ability of other users to access data. This command line option will disable the differential expression feature, including the removal of the `Differential expression` button.

`--disable-annotations`: annotations, which is enabled by default, may not be appropriate for hosted environments. It will write to the local file system, and in extreme cases could be used to abuse (or exceed) file system capacity on the hosting server. We recommend disabling this with this flag.

`--annotations-file`: this specifies a single file for all end-user annotations, and is incompatible with hosted or multi-user use of cellxgene. Using it will cause loss of user annotation data (ie, the CSV file will be overwritten). If you wish to explore using the annotations feature in a multi-user environment, please refer to the [annotations documentation](/docs/05__Annotate%20and%20Analyze%20Your%20Data/5_4__Annotating%20Data), and in particular the `--annotations-dir` flag.

## Community Software Projects

There are a number of teams building tools or infrastructure to better utilize cellxgene in a multiple user environment. While we do not endorse any particular solution, you may find the following helpful.

- [Novartis Cellxgene Gateway](https://github.com/Novartis/cellxgene-gateway) - a multiple-user and multiple-dataset gateway for cellxgene
- [Interactive Environment in the Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) ([patch notes](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/release_19.05/releases/19.05_announce.html))

If you know of other solutions, drop us a note and we'll add to this list.

## Cellxgene Gateway/Apache2 Reverse Proxy with Authentication

### Contributors

Fabian Rost and Alexandre Mestiashvili

### Hosting Use Case

- Private self-hosting of multiple datasets for multiple groups
- Groups only have access to datasets that they "own"
- Password Authentication

### General Description

Start multiple cellxgene-gateway instances for each of the different user groups and use a reverse proxy for authentication and forwarding to the different cellxgene instances.

### Components

[CellxGene Gateway](https://github.com/Novartis/cellxgene-gateway)

- Application to be run

[Apache Reverse Proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html)

- Used as a reverse proxy to redirect web requests and provide authentication

### Hosting Use Case

- Cellxgene desktop deployed with elastic beanstalk
- Used to host data in a read-only fashion (can't use annotations)
- Solution for an AWS compute environment

### Components

[CellxGene Desktop](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene)
