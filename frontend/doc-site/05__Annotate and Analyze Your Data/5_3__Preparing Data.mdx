# Prepare Data

## Data Format Requirements

If your data is an h5ad file and meets the following requirements, you can go straight to cellxgene launch.

- Matrix data (usually raw or normalized expression values) in `anndata.X`
- At least one embedding (e.g., tSNE, UMAP) in `anndata.obsm`, specified with the `prefix X_` (e.g., by default scanpy stores UMAP coordinates in `anndata.obsm['X_umap']`)
- A unique identifier is required for each cell, which by default will be pulled from the `obs` DataFrame index. If the index is not unique or does not contain the cell ID, an alternative column can be specified with `--obs-names`
- A unique identifier is required for each gene, which by default will be pulled from the `var `DataFrame index. If the index is not unique or does not contain the gene ID, an alternative column can be specified with `--var-names`

**What about R objects from Seurat or Bioconductor!?**
You can use sceasy to convert to h5ad. Seurat also has conversion tools that you can try.

**Can I use data hosted on the web somewhere?**
Yes! You can launch from a URL instead of a filepath. The same data format requirements apply. Please see here

## Data Format Options

**Category Colors**

`cellxgene` will display scanpy-style color information for category-label pairs. An example of this format is shown below:

```
>>> category = "louvain"
>>> # colors stored in adata.uns must be matplotlib-compatible color information
>>> adata.uns[f"{category}_colors"]
array(['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c', '#d62728', '#9467bd', '#8c564b', '#e377c2', '#bcbd22'], dtype='>> # there must be a matching category in adata.obs
>>> category in adata.obs
True
```

To test that you've done this properly, check that for your given category the number of colors match the number of category values and that the second command below results in a mapping from categories to colors.

```
>>> len(adata.obs[category].cat.categories) == len(adata.uns[f"{category}_colors"])
True
>>> dict(zip(adata.obs[category].cat.categories, adata.uns[f"{category}_colors"]))
{'CD4 T cells': '#1f77b4', 'CD14+ Monocytes': '#ff7f0e', 'B cells': '#2ca02c', 'CD8 T cells': '#d62728', 'NK cells': '#9467bd', 'FCGR3A+ Monocytes': '#8c564b', 'Dendritic cells': '#e377c2', 'Megakaryocytes': '#bcbd22'}
```

You can disable this feature using the `--disable-custom-colors` flag for `cellxgene launch`. cellxgene will then chose colors from its standard color palettes.

## Using `cellxgene prepare`

If you need to normalize your data and create an embedding, `cellxgene` can do that for you with the `prepare` command.

## What is `cellxgene prepare`?

`cellxgene prepare` offers an easy command line interface (CLI) to preliminarily wrangle your data into the required format for previewing it with CELLxGENE Annotate. It runs `scanpy` under the hood and can read in any format that is currently supported by `scanpy`, including mtx, loom, and more listed in the [scanpy documentation](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generated/scanpy.read.html).

`prepare` uses `scanpy` to:

- Handle simple data normalization (from a recipe)
- Do basic preprocessing, run PCA, and compute the neighbor graph
- Generate UMAP and tSNE embeddings
- Infer clusters using Louvain

You can control which steps to run and their methods (when applicable), via the CLI. The CLI also includes options for computing QC metrics, enforcing matrix sparcity, specifying index names, and plotting output.

## What is `cellxgene prepare` not?

`cellxgene prepare` is _not_ meant as a way to formally process or analyze your data. It's simply a utility for quickly wrangling your data into cellxgene-compatible format and computing a "vanilla" embedding so you can try out `cellxgene` and get a general sense of a dataset.

## Quickstart for cellxgene prepare

```
pip3 install cellxgene[prepare]
cellxgene prepare dataset.h5ad --output=dataset-processed.h5ad
```

This will load the input data, perform PCA and nearest neighbor calculations, compute `UMAP` and `tSNE` embeddings and `louvain` cluster assignments, and save the results in a new file called `dataset-processed.h5ad` that can be loaded using `cellxgene launch`.

## Example usage

As a quick example, let's construct a command to use `prepare` to take a raw expression matrix and generate a processed `h5ad` ready to visualize with CELLxGENE Annotate.

We'll start off using the raw data from the pbmc3k dataset. This dataset is described here, and is available as part of the scanpy package. For this example, we'll assume this raw data is stored in a file called `pbmc3k-raw.h5ad`.

Our prepare command looks like this:

```
cellxgene prepare pbmc3k-raw.h5ad \
    --run-qc \                                  # (A)
    --recipe seurat \                           # (B)
    --layout tsne --layout umap \               # (C)
    --output pbmc3k-prepared.h5ad               # (D)
```

Let's look at what prepare is doing to our data, and how each step relates to the command above. You can see a walkthrough of what's going on under the hood for this example in [this notebook](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-vignettes/blob/master/dataset-processing/pbmc3k-prepare-example.ipynb).

- (A) - Compute quality control metrics and store this in our AnnData object for later inspection
- (B) - Normalize the expression matrix using a basic preprocessing recipe (auto) - Do some preprocessing to run PCA and compute the neighbor graph (auto) - Infer clusters with the Louvain algorithm and store these labels to visualize later
- (C) - Compute and store UMAP and tSNE embeddings
- (D) - Write results to file\_

## Options for `cellxgene prepare`

_For the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of options, run `cellxgene prepare --help`_
`--embedding controls` which dimensionality reduction algorithm is applies to your data. Options are `umap` and/or `tsne`. Defaults to both.

`--recipe controls` which normalization steps to apply to your data, based on one of the preprocessing `recipes` included with `scanpy`. These recipes include steps like cell filtering and gene selection; see the `scanpy` documentation THIS LINK IS BROKEN for more details. Options are `none`, `seurat`, or `zheng17`. Defaults to `none`.

`--sparse` is a flag determines whether to enforce a sparse matrix. For large datasets, `prepare` can take a long time to run (a few minutes for datasets with 10-100k cells, up to an hour or more for datasets with >100k cells). If you want `prepare` to run faster we recommend using the `sparse` option. If this flag is not included, default is `False`

`--skip-qc` by default, `cellxgene prepare` will compute quality control metrics (saved to `anndata.obs` and `anndata.var`) as described in the`scanpy` documentation THIS LINK IS BROKEN. Pass this flag if you would like to skip this step.

`--make-obs-names-unique` /` --make-var-names-unique` determine whether to rename `obs` (cell) / `var` (gene) names, respectively, to be unique. Default is `True`.

`--set-obs-names` controls which field in `anndata.obs` (cell metadata) is used as the index for cells (e.g., a cell ID column). Default is `anndata.obs.names`

`--set-var-names` controls which field in `anndata.var` (gene metadata) is used as the index for genes. Default is `anndata.var.names`

`--output` and `--overwrite` control where the processed data is saved.

## Deprecation of Seurat Downloads on CELLxGENE Discover

We are deprecating Seurat downloads on the CELLxGENE Discover platform, effective late 2024. While Seurat support has served many of our users, ongoing support has become unsustainable due to limitations in conversion tools and cross-ecosystem interoperability.This decision aligns with our shift towards a Python-based ecosystem, consistent with our Virtual Cell Platform (VCP) and Census strategies. As our platform increasingly supports new types of spatial and multimodal assays, focusing on Python will enable us to deliver a more consistent and scalable user experience.

### Availability of Earlier Seurat Downloads

Please note that earlier Seurat downloads will continue to be available. Previous versions of datasets will not be removed, and any Seurat RDS files that were previously downloaded will remain accessible. These can still be accessed via their URL (encoded as a citation in the dataset's @misc slot) or through the Discover API (`GET dataset versions`). This ensures that any ongoing research is not disrupted.

### Recommended Alternatives

For users seeking alternatives, we recommend leveraging the AnnData format, which integrates well with the Python-based scverse toolchain (including scanpy and squidpy). For R users, the preferred approach is to utilize the CELLxGENE Census R API or tools such as the cellxgenedp package, which can convert AnnData datasets into formats compatible with R toolchains like Bioconductor. This solution allows continued access to high-quality data and analytical capabilities without the challenges associated with Seurat conversions.

If you need to convert h5ad files to Seurat, there are some community-supported tools that can assist with this task, though we caution that these tools may be less stable. Please reach out to the Seurat community for supported methods of conversion from AnnData to Seurat formats. We appreciate your understanding as we continue to refine our platform for reliability and future growth.

### Converting `h5ad` Files to Seurat `RDS` Files

To convert an `h5ad` file (used by Scanpy) to a Seurat `RDS` file (for use in R), you can follow a few key steps that involve using intermediate conversions and specific R packages.

### Option 1 - Using `zellkonverter` and `SingleCellExperiment`

**1. You will need `zellkonverter` and `SingleCellExperiment` installed. Run the following in R:**

```R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("zellkonverter")
BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")
```

**2. Load the .h5ad file and convert it**

```R
library(zellkonverter)
library(SingleCellExperiment)

# Specify the path to your .h5ad file
h5ad_file <- "path/to/your/file.h5ad"

# Read the .h5ad file into a SingleCellExperiment object
sce <- readH5AD(h5ad_file)

# Save the object as an .rds file
saveRDS(sce, file = "output_file.rds")
```

**3. Verify and Load the RDS file**

```R
sce_loaded <- readRDS("output_file.rds")
```

### Option 2 - Using `SeuratDisk`

**1. Convert the `h5ad` file into an `h5Seurat` file using the `Convert` function:**

```R
library(SeuratDisk)
Convert("path_to_file.h5ad", dest = "h5seurat", overwrite = TRUE)
```

**2. Load the `h5Seurat` file into a Seurat object:**

```R
seurat_object <- LoadH5Seurat("path_to_file.h5seurat")
```

**3. Save the Seurat object as an `RDS` file:**

```R
saveRDS(seurat_object, file = "output_file.rds")
```

**4. Verify and Load the `RDS` file**

```R
seurat_loaded <- readRDS("output_file.rds")
```

### Option 3 - Using `reticulate` with Python's Scanpy

If you encounter issues or need to customize the conversion, you can read the `h5ad` file in Python using the reticulate package and extract the necessary data into R:

**1. Import the scanpy package and read the h5ad file:**

```R
library(reticulate)
scanpy <- import("scanpy")
adata <- scanpy$read_h5ad("path/to/your/file.h5ad")
```

**2. Extract the count data and convert it into a Seurat object:**

```R
counts <- t(adata$layers["counts"])
colnames(counts) <- adata$obs_names$to_list()
rownames(counts) <- adata$var_names$to_list()
counts <- Matrix::Matrix(as.matrix(counts), sparse = TRUE)

seurat_obj <- CreateSeuratObject(counts)
saveRDS(seurat_obj, "output_file.rds")

```

These methods provide flexibility for handling different versions or data structures in your h5ad files. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the documentation on [SeuratDisk's GitHub](https://mojaveazure.github.io/seurat-disk/articles/convert-anndata.html) and [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues).
