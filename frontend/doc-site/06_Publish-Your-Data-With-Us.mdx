# Publish Your Data With Us

Not  to brag, but we  currently host the worldâ€™s largest collection of single cell data.  We are  continuing to grow both  healthy and diseased datasets as we continue our work to make the CellxGene data portal an open science resource for the single cell community.

We provide a public browser and commit to a permanent URL, so links to data on our site will never break or need to be updated.  We also employ  a team of curators who partner with you  to ensure your data is in the appropriate format for our portal and includes all appropriate metadata your colleague might need to explore and learn from your work.  Furthermore, we aim to be known as a home not only for the most data, but one for high quality, reliable, and accurate data.

Think your data set would like to live on the CellxGene Data Portal? Drop us a line: [cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com](mailto:cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com)  

We look forward to building an open science future with you.
