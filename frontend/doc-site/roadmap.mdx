# Roadmap

## Roadmap Vision

We are building cellxgene, a data publishing and exploration platform that maximizes the reusability of published data by standardizing it and making it findable and accessible. Cellxgene will provide cell-centric data access APIs for computational reuse and interactive graphical interfaces so that biologists and physicians can ask questions directly of the data.

## Roadmap Themes

Our technology roadmap aims to:

1. Make it easier to find data and evaluate if existing data can be used to answer novel research questions
2. Make it easier for biologists, physicians, and computational biologists to use data to answer questions

## Features

We are planning to develop the following features on the Data Portal application. The Status column has one of three statuses:

* Development: Our engineering team is currently working hard to deliver this feature.
* Discovery: We're in the process of defining requirements and prototyping this feature.
* Not Started: Self explanatory! We haven't started Discovery yet.

## Please Note

* Our roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and updates to our strategy.
* We update our roadmap every six months, this represents our best assessment of our future plans.
* We are fairly confident in delivering features in the short term. Longer term features we are less certain about what features we will deliver but are included to illustrate our vision for cellxgene.
