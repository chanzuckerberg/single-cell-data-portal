# Gene Expression Source Data

Two versions of Gene Expression data can be downloaded. The <NextLink href="https://ge-data.cellxgene.cziscience.com/expression-summary-full-07-23-23.csv.gz">full dataset</NextLink> contains the summed expression, number of cells with nonzero expression, and total number of cells for all possible combinations of metadata displayed in Gene Expression (organism, tissue, gene, cell type, dataset, disease, self-reported ethnicity, publication, and sex). The <NextLink href="https://ge-data.cellxgene.cziscience.com/expression-summary-condensed-07-23-23.csv.gz">condensed dataset</NextLink> reports the same measurements for all possible combinations of organism, tissue, cell type, and gene. These datasets were generated on and reflect the state of CZ CELLxGENE Discover on July 23, 2023.
