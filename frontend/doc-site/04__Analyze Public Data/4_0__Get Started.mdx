# Analyze Public Data

CellxGene provides several two visual tools to explore the data sets we host. These tools allow for powerful hypothesis exploration with functionalities including subsetting, differential expression, and others to help you explore the data.

In order to understand which tool will best meet your needs, it’s helpful to understand the difference between our two main tools for exploring hosted data. Once you decide which tool you want to use, click on it’s name to view the tutorials.

## The Hosted Data Explorer

The hosted data explorer allows you to _explore individual data sets_ hosted on the CellxGene platform in UMAP form (<NextLink href="/docs/04__Analyze%20Public%20Data/4_1__Hosted%20Tutorials">learn</NextLink>, [example dataset](https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/e/53d208b0-2cfd-4366-9866-c3c6114081bc.cxg/)).

scExpression allows for an _exploration of gene expression by cell type across all
data sets_ in the CellxGene data corpus. It is currently in beta.
