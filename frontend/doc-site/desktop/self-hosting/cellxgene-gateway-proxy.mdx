## Contributors:

Fabian Rost and Alexandre Mestiashvili

## Hosting Use Case:

* Private self-hosting of multiple datasets for multiple groups
* Groups only have access to datasets that they "own"
* Password Authentication

## General description:

Start multiple cellxgene-gateway instances for each of the different user groups and use a reverse proxy for authentication and forwarding to the different cellxgene instances.

## Components:

* [Cellxgene Gateway](https://github.com/Novartis/cellxgene-gateway): the application to be run
* [Apache Reverse Proxy](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/reverse_proxy.html): used as a reverse proxy to redirect web requests and provide authentication
