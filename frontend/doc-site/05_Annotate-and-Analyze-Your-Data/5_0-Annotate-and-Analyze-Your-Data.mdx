# Annotate and Analyze Your Data

Our desktop tool is a powerful interface that allows you to annotate, analyze, and explore your own single cell data.

In this section, youâ€™ll find information about how to run an instance of our desktop application, how to prepare your data, how our annotations function works, and how you can use our gene sets tool to better understand your data.

We believe this is a powerful tool that can help you better understand and trust your data - if you have any questions about how to use this tool, drop us a line at: [[cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com]](mailto:cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com)
