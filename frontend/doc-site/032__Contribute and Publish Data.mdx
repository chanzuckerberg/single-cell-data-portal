# Contributing Data

Cellxgene has a rapidly growing single cell data corpus because of generous contributions from researchers like you! If you feel like you have a single cell dataset that meets our requirments (see below), then feel free to reach out to our curation team at [cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com](cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com).

## Publishing Process

The general process for submission to the portal looks like this:
- reach out to our curation team at [cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com](cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com) with a description of the dataset that you'd like to contribute. Generally speaking this would be derived from either human or mouse. We not allow submission of data sets from:
  - organisms other than human or mouse
  - cell lines
  - drug screens 
- recieve confirmation form the curation team will accept your dataset along with instructions on how to format your dataset for submission.
- Prepare your dataset and email our curators for further assistance in the process
- Publish!



## Dataset Requirements

We need the following collection metadata (i.e. details associate with your publication or study)

- Collection information:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Contact: name and email
  - Publication/preprint DOI: can be added later
  - URLs: any additional URLs for related data or resources, such as GEO or protocols.io - can be added later
 
Datasets need the following information added to a single h5ad (AnnData) format file per cellxgene visualization:
- **Dataset-level metadata in uns**:
  - schema_version: '2.0.0'
  - title: title of the individual dataset visualization
  - X_normalization: method used to normalize the data stored in X and any scaling or logging; 'none' if data in X is raw 
  - optional: batch_condition: list of obs fields that define that “batches” that a normalization or integration algorithm should be aware of
- **Data in .X and raw.X**:
  - raw counts are required
  - normalized counts are strongly recommended
  - raw counts should be in raw.X if normalized counts are in .X
  - if there is no normalized matrix, raw counts should be in .X
- **Cells metadata in obs (the most specific term available from the specified ontology)**:
  - organism_ontology_term_id: NCBITaxon (NCBITaxon:9606 for human, NCBITaxon:10090 for mouse)
  - tissue_ontology_term_id: UBERON
  - assay_ontology_term _id: EFO
  - disease_ontology_term _id: MONDO or PATO:0000461 for ‘normal’
  - cell_type_ontology_term _id: CL
  - ethnicity_ontology_term _id: HANCESTRO if human, ‘unknown’ if info unavailable, ‘na’ if non-human
  - development_stage_ontology_term _id: HsapDv if human, MmusDv if mouse, ‘unknown’ if info unavailable
  - sex_ontology_term_id: PATO:0000384 for male, PATO:0000383 for female, or ‘unknown’ if unavailable
- **Embeddings in obsm**:
  - One or more two-dimensional embeddings, prefixed with 'X_'
- **Features in var & raw.var (if present)**:
  - index is Ensembl ID
  - preference is that gene have not been filtered in order to maximize future data integration efforts
