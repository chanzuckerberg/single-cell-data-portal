# Contributing Data

CELLxGENE supports a rapidly growing single-cell data corpus because of generous contributions from researchers like you!

## Submission and Publication Process

1. Review the [Data Eligibility](#data-eligibility) criteria to ensure your data complies with these requirements
2. [Contact us] with a description of the data that you'd like to contribute to confirm that we will accept your data
3. Once confirmed, you send us files prepared according to the submission [Requirements](#dataset-requirements)
4. We upload to a private Collection where you can review
5. The submission can be revised, as needed
6. The data are made openly available when you are ready

## Dataset Requirements

### Data Eligibility

CELLxGENE supports most single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, but a few types of data are **not** accepted at this time:

- drug screens
- cell lines
- species not on the [supported list](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/single-cell-curation/latest-schema.html#organism_ontology_term_id)
- assays not on the [supported list](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene-census/blob/main/docs/census_accepted_assays.csv)
  - these additional assays are accepted:
    - expression data from paired (i.e. multi-modal) assays (e.g. 10x multiome, mCT-seq)
    - unpaired scATAC-seq gene activity matrices with fragments file

CELLxGENE continues to expand support for additional species and assays so please [contact us] if you are interested in submitting data not currently covered by the supported lists.

### Scale Constraints

CELLxGENE Discover sets the maximum per dataset file size for submissions to 50 GB. Additionally, datasets with more than 4.3 million cells can be submitted but will not visualized in CELLxGENE Explorer.

### Formatting Requirements

Include the following Collection metadata in your emails to describe your publication or study, all of which can be edited as titles, abstracts, etc. change:

- **Collection information**:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Contact: a single name and email
  - Publication/preprint DOI: _optional_
  - URLs _optional_
    - any links to the corresponding raw sequence data, protocols, and other related data or resources
  - Consortia _optional_
    - one or more of those listed [here](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-data-portal/blob/main/backend/layers/common/validation.py#L12)

The full schema is documented [here](https://chanzuckerberg.github.io/single-cell-curation/latest-schema.html) but is summarized below. Each dataset needs the following information added to a single h5ad (AnnData 0.10) format file:

- **Dataset-level metadata in uns**:
