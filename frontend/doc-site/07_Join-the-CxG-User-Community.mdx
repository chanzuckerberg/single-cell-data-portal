CellxGene is guided by the principle of building with, not for. We love to hear from and connect with our community so we can learn to improve our tool and develop new features that meet your needs. Below are some ways to get in touch with us:

Join Our User Community on GitHub: Join our GitHub community to connect with the CellxGene team who can answer any questions you might have, review questions other users have posed, and connect with other scientists working with single cell data.

Send Us An Email:  If GitHub is not your thing, but you still have questions or feedback, no sweat. Just send us a message and our team will get back to you ASAP: cellxgene@chanzuckerberg.com
