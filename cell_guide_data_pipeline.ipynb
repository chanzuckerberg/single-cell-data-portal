      "A cell is the basic unit of life. Cells perform a variety of functions necessary for the survival of an organism. They carry out functions such as energy production, protein synthesis, and cell division. Cells vary in size, shape and function depending on their location and role in the body. While some cells function independently, others work together to form tissues and organs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two main types of cells - eukaryotic and prokaryotic. Prokaryotic cells are simpler in structure and lack a membrane-bound nucleus. They are found in organisms such as bacteria and archaea. Eukaryotic cells, on the other hand, are more complex and include a nucleus that houses the cell’s genetic material. Eukaryotic cells are found in all organisms except for bacteria and archaea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cell function is controlled by the interaction of numerous molecules, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates within the cell membrane. The membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer, consisting of polar heads and nonpolar tails that form a barrier between the inside and the outside of the cell. Various processes, including diffusion and active transport, allow molecules and ions to pass through this barrier, maintaining the cell’s internal environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, cells are essential to the survival of living organisms, carrying out critical functions that allow for the maintenance of life. Through their complex interactions, cells work together to carry out countless roles, providing essential support to the many tissues and organs that make up our bodies.\n",
      "CL:0000540 neuron\n",
      "A neuron is a specialized cell that is responsible for transmitting electrical and chemical signals throughout the nervous system. They are the primary cells that make up the brain, spinal cord and nervous system. The structure of a neuron is unique, it consists of a cell body with extensions known as dendrites which receive signals from other neurons or sensory cells and transmit that information towards the cell body. From the cell body, a long projection called an axon carries impulses away from the cell body and towards other neurons or muscles and glands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neurons function in the nervous system to transmit information in the form of electrical and chemical signals. These signals allow us to think, learn, process and respond to sensory information about the world around us. Neurons can be categorized in different ways based on their function, location, and shape. Sensory neurons receive sensory information such as touch, sight or sound and transmit it towards the central nervous system. Motor neurons take instructions from the central nervous system and coordinate muscle movements. Interneurons are the connecting link between sensory and motor neurons, allowing for processing and integration of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function of neurons in the body is essential. Damage to neurons can cause serious neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Multiple Sclerosis, highlighting how detrimental their function is when disrupted. Studying neurons, their networks and connections is an active area of research, which can further our understanding of disease states and improve potential therapies.\n",
      "CL:0000101 sensory neuron\n",
      "Sensory neurons, also known as afferent neurons, are specialized cells responsible for the detection, transduction, and transmission of sensory information from different parts of the body to the central nervous system. They are primarily found in sensory organs, such as the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, and are essential components of sensory pathways that help us perceive the world around us.\n",
      "\n",
      "These neurons are designed to respond to various stimuli, including light, sound, pressure, temperature, and chemical substances. They have specialized structures called receptors that are activated when these stimuli are detected. The receptors then generate electrical signals, called impulses, that travel along the axons of sensory neurons to the central nervous system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the impulses reach the central nervous system, they are processed and interpreted by the brain and spinal cord, which then generate appropriate responses. For example, when a sensory neuron detects a painful stimulus, such as a hot stove, it sends impulses to the brain, which responds by triggering the withdrawal reflex to remove the affected body part from the heat source.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, sensory neurons are crucial cells that help us perceive and respond to the different stimuli in our environment. Without them, our ability to interact with the world around us would be severely limited.\n",
      "CL:0000001 primary cultured cell\n",
      "Primary cultured cells are cells that have been isolated from a tissue or organism and placed into a culture dish where they are allowed to grow and multiply. These cells are considered \"primary\" because they come directly from the tissue or organism and have not been previously cultured. They represent a close approximation of the in vivo cellular environment and retain many of their original physiological properties. Primary cultured cells are an important tool in cell biology research, particularly for investigating the biological processes and mechanisms that occur in living cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Primary cultured cells can be derived from a variety of tissues and organisms, including human and animal tissues. They can be used to study a wide range of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and senescence, as well as cellular responses to environmental cues such as growth factors or drugs. They can also be used to investigate the roles of specific genes in cellular processes, by introducing gene knockdown or overexpression techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, primary cultured cells are a valuable resource for researchers and have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes. They serve as a close approximation of the in vivo cellular environment and help to bridge the gap between in vitro experiments and observations made in living organisms. Their versatility and usefulness in investigating various cellular processes make them a valuable tool for scientific research.\n",
      "CL:0000010 cultured cell\n",
      "A \"cultured cell\" is a type of cell that has been grown and maintained outside of its natural environment in a laboratory setting. These cells are often used in research studies to investigate basic biological processes, as well as to develop and test new drugs and therapies. Cultured cells can be derived from a variety of sources, such as human or animal tissue, and can be grown under specific conditions that promote their survival and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of cultured cells has revolutionized many areas of biomedical research, including cancer, genetics, and immunology. Cultured cells provide an easily accessible and reproducible model system for studying complex cellular processes, enabling scientists to manipulate and observe individual cells in ways that would be impossible in vivo. In addition, because cultured cells can be grown in large quantities, they offer a valuable resource for drug discovery and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are limitations to the use of cultured cells. For example, cultured cells are often not fully representative of the complexity and diversity of cells within an intact organism. In addition, because cultured cells are often derived from a single source and grown under highly controlled conditions, they may not accurately reflect the complex interactions that occur between cells in vivo. Nonetheless, the use of cultured cells remains a valuable and important tool in modern biomedical research, and continues to offer insights into the fundamental workings of living systems.\n",
      "CL:0000002 obsolete immortal cell line cell\n",
      "Obsolete immortal cell line cells, also known as transformed cells, are cells that have been artificially altered to have an unlimited lifespan through consistent cell division. These cells have lost the ability to undergo apoptosis and senescence, which gives them an infinite replication capacity. Although these cells divide indefinitely, they do not necessarily have normal cell functions. Due to their accumulation of genetic changes, they often have different morphologies, growth rates, and expression of genes compared to their normal counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "These cells have been extensively used in research to elucidate molecular mechanisms of various diseases and biological processes. For example, many cancer cell lines, derived from transformed cells, have been used to study the behaviors and characteristics of cancer cells and to develop new cancer treatments. Additionally, transformed cell lines are established tools for developing vaccines, producing monoclonal antibodies, and creating other therapeutic proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the use of transformed cells for research purposes can be controversial due to potential differences with normal cells. Results obtained from transformed cells should always be carefully validated with appropriate controls using non-transformed cells. Despite their limitations, these cells remain a powerful tool in biomedical research and are essential to advancing our understanding of cellular and molecular processes.\n",
      "CL:0000003 native cell\n",
      "A native cell, also known as a primary cell, is a type of cell that is isolated directly from an organism or tissue and has not undergone any modifications or transformations in vitro. These cells are therefore considered pure and retain their original properties, which are often lost in cell lines that have been cultured for extended periods of time. \n",
      "Native cells are critical in biomedical research, as they provide highly relevant and accurate models for studying cellular behavior and function in vivo. They are used in a wide range of applications, including drug discovery, toxicology, and disease modeling. \n",
      "\n",
      "One example of a native cell is the primary human fibroblast, which is commonly used in research related to skin diseases and wound healing. Primary fibroblasts are obtained directly from skin tissue and have been shown to exhibit distinct characteristics that cannot be accurately recapitulated in culture-adapted cell lines. These cells play a crucial role in understanding the regulation of extracellular matrix production, which is critical for tissue repair and maintenance. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to their fundamental importance in basic research, native cells are also being explored as potential therapeutic agents themselves. For example, primary T cells are being studied as a potential treatment for cancer, where they could be genetically engineered ex vivo to better recognize and attack tumor cells when they are reintroduced to the patient's body. Overall, the study of native cells continues to be a critical area of research in biology and biomedicine.\n",
      "CL:0000004 obsolete cell by organism\n",
      "\"Obsolete cell by organism\" is not a cell type recognized in the Cell Ontology as it is not a specific type of cell, but rather a general term that refers to any cell that is no longer needed by the organism and is in the process of being eliminated. This process is known as programmed cell death or apoptosis, and is an important mechanism for maintaining the health and function of tissues and organs in multicellular organisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apoptosis is a highly regulated process that can be triggered by a variety of signaling pathways, including those that are involved in development and tissue remodeling, as well as those that respond to cellular stress and damage. During apoptosis, the cell undergoes a series of morphological and biochemical changes that lead to its disassembly and removal by neighboring cells and immune cells. This ensures that the dying cell does not cause any harm or inflammation to the surrounding tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the elimination of obsolete or damaged cells by apoptosis is essential for the proper functioning of tissues and organs, and defects in this process can lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmune disorders. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and regulation of apoptosis in different cell types is an active area of research in cell biology and biomedical science.\n",
      "CL:0000005 fibroblast neural crest derived\n",
      "Fibroblast neural crest derived (FNCD) cells are a subpopulation of fibroblasts that originate from the neural crest during embryonic development. These cells are highly specialized and play a crucial role in the maintenance of connective tissue and extracellular matrix (ECM) in various organs and tissues. FNCD cells are involved in the development and homeostasis of neural, skeletal, and cardiac tissues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In neural tissue, FNCD cells promote the growth and maintenance of axons and dendrites, which are the specialized structures that transmit electrical signals between neurons. They also provide structural support to the nerve fibers and regulate the production of myelin, which insulates and protects the axons. In skeletal tissue, FNCD cells are responsible for synthesizing and organizing collagen fibers, which provide tensile strength to bones and cartilage. In cardiac tissue, FNCD cells contribute to the formation of the cardiac extracellular matrix and regulate the contractility of cardiomyocytes, the cells that make up the heart muscle.\n",
      "\n",
      "FNCD cells have a unique molecular and morphological signature that distinguishes them from other fibroblast subtypes. They express a variety of neural crest-specific genes, such as p75NTR, Sox10, and Snail, which are crucial for their development and function. They also have a highly branched morphology and secrete a specialized ECM that is rich in glycosaminoglycans and fibronectin. FNCD cells can undergo phenotypic switching in response to injury or disease, leading to aberrant ECM deposition and tissue fibrosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, fibroblast neural crest derived cells are a specialized subtype of fibroblasts that are essential for the development and maintenance of connective tissue and ECM in various organs and tissues. They have a unique molecular signature and play a critical role in neural, skeletal, and cardiac tissue homeostasis. Dysfunction of these cells can lead to tissue fibrosis and functional impairment of the affected organ or tissue.\n",
      "CL:0000057 fibroblast\n",
      "Fibroblasts are one of the most common cell types found in connective tissue. They are responsible for producing and maintaining the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support and a scaffold for cells within tissues. Fibroblasts are also involved in wound healing, tissue repair, and the regulation of inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and fibronectin, fibroblasts also secrete growth factors and cytokines that promote tissue repair and regeneration. They play a critical role in wound healing by migrating to the site of injury, proliferating, and laying down new extracellular matrix. Fibroblasts also help to remodel and repair damaged tissue by clearing away debris and promoting the infiltration of immune cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, fibroblasts are involved in regulating the immune response. They produce chemokines that attract white blood cells to sites of inflammation, and they express receptors for cytokines and growth factors that modulate the immune response. In some cases, fibroblasts may also differentiate into other cell types, such as myofibroblasts, which have contractile properties and are involved in tissue contraction and remodeling. Overall, fibroblasts are a critical component of connective tissue that contribute to homeostasis, repair, and regeneration.\n",
      "CL:0000333 migratory neural crest cell\n",
      "Migratory neural crest cells, also known as neural crest cells or NCCs, are a unique population of cells that originate from the embryonic ectoderm during early vertebrate development. NCCs are involved in a variety of critical processes, including the development of the peripheral nervous system, craniofacial structures, and certain endocrine glands. In addition to these developmental roles, NCCs are also implicated in a range of pathological conditions, including neuroblastoma and melanoma.\n",
      "\n",
      "During development, NCCs undergo a complex migration process, during which they navigate through a variety of tissue environments, including the developing embryonic tissues, the extracellular matrix, and the extracellular fluid. This migration is regulated by a variety of molecular signals, including chemokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules, which ensure that NCCs migrate to the correct locations and differentiate into the appropriate cell types. Once they have reached their target destinations, NCCs undergo differentiation into a range of cell types, including sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and glial cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, migratory neural crest cells are a crucial population of cells that play a critical role in both embryonic development and pathological conditions. Their ability to migrate to different locations and differentiate into a range of cell types makes them an essential component of the peripheral nervous system and the human body as a whole. Further research into the molecular mechanisms that regulate NCC migration and differentiation will be important in the development of new therapies for a range of neurological and developmental disorders.\n",
      "CL:0000008 migratory cranial neural crest cell\n",
      "Migratory cranial neural crest cells are a group of cells that originate from the dorsal folds of the neural tube during embryonic development. These cells migrate away from the neural tube towards the facial region and branchial arches to form a diverse set of structures including cartilage, bone, connective tissue, and sensory neurons in the face, head, and neck. This dynamic group of cells has the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types and play an important role in the formation of various structures during embryonic development.\n",
      "\n",
      "During migration, the cranial neural crest cells undergo significant changes in gene expression to regulate cell adhesion, signaling and differentiation, as well as physical changes in cell shape. The timing, direction, and final location of the migration of these cells are tightly regulated by various signaling pathways such as BMP, WNT, and FGF. These signaling pathways modulate the migration of the cranial neural crest cells as well as their differentiation into the various cell types required for proper facial and cranial development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, migratory cranial neural crest cells are a crucial group of cells involved in the development of facial and cranial structures during embryonic development.

These cells are highly specialized and are found in various parts of the body including the retina of the eye, the inner ear, and the olfactory system. These cells allow us to see, hear, taste, smell, and feel different sensations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neuronal receptor cells are often characterized by their ability to convert external stimuli into electrical impulses that can be transmitted to the brain for processing. For example, in the retina of the eye, there are two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, which are responsible for converting light into electrical signals that can be processed by the brain to create visual images. Similarly, the hair cells in the inner ear respond to sound waves and convert them into electrical signals that are sent to the brain for interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from their ability to detect and respond to external stimuli, neuronal receptor cells also play a critical role in maintaining homeostasis within the body. For example, certain receptor cells located in the hypothalamus of the brain are responsible for sensing changes in the levels of hormones and other signaling molecules in the blood, and can adjust the release of other hormones in response to these changes. Overall, neuronal receptor cells are vital components of our sensory and nervous systems, allowing us to interact with the world around us and maintain internal physiological balance.\n",
      "CL:0000197 sensory receptor cell\n",
      "Sensory receptor cells are specialized cells that are responsible for detecting different types of stimuli or signals from the environment. These cells are found throughout the human body and are capable of sensing a variety of things such as light, sound, pressure, temperature, and chemical components of food and air. The detection of these signals is then converted into electrical signals for the brain to interpret and process.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many different types of sensory receptor cells, each responsible for sensing a specific type of signal. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye sense light and initiate visual processing, while hair cells in the ear detect vibrations and are involved in hearing.

      "CL:0000007 early embryonic cell (metazoa)\n",
      "Early embryonic cells are the earliest cells that form during embryonic development in animals. These cells arise from the fertilized egg and give rise to all the specialized cells that make up an organism. These cells are pluripotent, meaning they have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body, a property known as totipotency. Early embryonic cells are present during the blastula stage of development, which occurs shortly after fertilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "During embryonic development, early embryonic cells play a vital role in the formation of the embryo. As these cells divide and differentiate, they give rise to the various tissues and organs that make up the body. Early embryonic cells are also responsible for establishing the body plan of the developing embryo. This process is known as gastrulation and involves the formation of three distinct germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. These germ layers go on to give rise to all the different tissues and organs of the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to their important role in embryonic development, early embryonic cells have also garnered significant attention in the field of regenerative medicine. Because of their pluripotent nature, these cells have the potential to differentiate into any cell type in the body, making them a promising source of cells for tissue engineering and replacement therapies. Despite their potential, however, research on early embryonic cells has been limited due to ethical concerns surrounding the use of human embryos. Nonetheless, studies using animal models have shown promise in using these cells to repair damaged tissues and organs.\n",

      "Obsolete dentine secreting cells are specialized cells found in the dental pulp of deciduous and permanent teeth that are responsible for producing dentin during tooth development. These cells are derived from the dental papilla and are generally found in the root of the tooth. Dentin is a hard, calcified tissue that forms the bulk of the tooth structure and provides mechanical support to the overlying enamel and cementum. The secretion of dentin by the obsolete dentine secreting cells is a crucial step in tooth development and is tightly regulated by various signaling pathways and molecular factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "During tooth development, the obsolete dentine secreting cells differentiate into odontoblasts, which are responsible for the secretion of the organic matrix that eventually becomes mineralized to form dentin. Once dentin is fully formed, the odontoblasts typically become embedded within the newly formed tissue and adopt a more quiescent state. In some cases, however, the cells may continue to secrete dentin throughout the life of the tooth in response to various stimuli such as caries or mechanical trauma.\n",

      "CL:0000675 female gamete\n",
      "Female gametes, also known as ova or eggs, are specialized cells produced by the female reproductive system. Their main function is to fuse with a sperm cell during fertilization, ultimately giving rise to a zygote that will develop into a new individual. Female gametes are among the largest cells produced by the human body and are characterized by a rounded shape, complete with a nucleus, cytoplasm, and a thin outer membrane.\n",
      "\n",
      "Female gametogenesis starts during embryonic development, with the formation of the primordial follicles, which will serve as the precursors of mature ova. As a female reaches puberty, one follicle per month is selected to become dominant and undergo a complex process of maturation that lasts several weeks. During this process, a single rounded egg is released into the fallopian tube, where it can wait to be fertilized by sperm for up to 24 hours. If fertilization occurs, the egg will fuse with the sperm's genetic material and initiate a process of rapid cell division that will give rise to an embryo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, female gametes play a crucial role in sexual reproduction. They are specialized cells that are produced by the female reproductive system and are responsible for fusing with sperm cells to create new individuals. Although only one egg is released per cycle, the process of gametogenesis is essential for the continuation of the human species.\n",
      "CL:0000026 invertebrate nurse cell\n",
      "Invertebrate nurse cells are specialized cells that are found in the ovary of female insects such as Drosophila melanogaster. These cells are essential for the proper development of the oocyte, as they provide it with nutrients and other factors necessary for growth. Nurse cells are connected to the developing oocyte by cytoplasmic bridges, which allow for the transfer of proteins, RNAs, and other molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "During oogenesis, nurse cells undergo rapid proliferation and polyploidization, meaning that they contain multiple copies of their genome. This process allows for the production of large quantities of proteins, lipids, and other nutrients that are transported to the oocyte through the cytoplasmic bridges. In addition to providing nutrients, nurse cells are also involved in the removal of waste products from the developing oocyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from providing nutrients, nurse cells also play an important role in the localization of mRNAs and proteins within the developing oocyte. This process, known as oocyte polarity, is essential for the proper positioning of the body axis and the formation of specialized structures such as the germ cells and the nervous system. In summary, invertebrate nurse cells are specialized cells that are necessary for the proper development of the oocyte, and they provide it with nutrients, factors, and other molecules necessary for growth and differentiation.\n",
      "CL:0000412 polyploid cell\n",
      "Polyploid cells refer to cells that contain more than two sets of chromosomes in their nucleus. Instead of two copies of each chromosome, like in diploid cells, polyploid cells can have three, four, or even more copies. Polyploidy is a common phenomenon in many plant species, but it is also found in certain animal cells, such as liver cells and cardiomyocytes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polyploid cells play important roles in tissue growth and regeneration. For example, liver cells, or hepatocytes, are known for their ability to undergo polyploidization in response to injury or stress. The polyploidization process can increase the cell size and metabolic capacity, allowing the liver to regenerate and maintain its function. Similarly, polyploid cardiomyocytes have been shown to contribute to heart growth and regeneration in some animal models.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also evidence that polyploidy may be involved in cancer development and progression. Some cancer cells have been found to be polyploid, and it is thought that this genetic instability can contribute to tumor heterogeneity and aggressiveness. However, the exact role of polyploidy in cancer is still not fully understood and requires further investigation.\n",
      "CL:4029002 germline-derived nurse cell\n",
      "Germline-derived nurse cells are a unique type of somatic cell found in the ovaries of insects, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster. These cells are derived from the germline cells during oogenesis and play an essential role in the development of oocytes. They are responsible for nurturing and supporting the developing oocyte through the production of cytoplasmic organelles and other essential molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germline-derived nurse cells are connected to the developing oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges called ring canals. These ring canals allow for the transport of molecules between the nurse cells and the developing oocyte, enabling the nurse cells to provide the oocyte with the necessary materials for its development. The nurse cells also play a critical role in regulating the timing of oocyte maturation and egg development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to their essential role in the development of oocytes, germline-derived nurse cells have also been found to play a role in the regulation of gene expression during oogenesis. Recent studies have suggested that nurse cells may be involved in the targeted degradation of specific mRNAs in the oocyte, thereby regulating the translation of specific genes during oogenesis. This suggests that nurse cells may play an even more critical role in the development and maturation of eggs than previously thought.\n",
      "CL:0000722 cystoblast\n",
      "Cystoblasts are female germ cells that are typically found in the ovaries of many animals, including insects. These cells are important in the production of eggs and play a crucial role in the reproductive cycle of many species. Cystoblasts start out as primordial germ cells, which are cells that migrate to the developing ovaries during embryonic development. These early germ cells then differentiate into cystoblasts, which will undergo several rounds of mitosis to form a group of interconnected cells that will eventually form individual eggs.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main functions of the cystoblast is to divide and differentiate into a group of interconnected cells known as a cyst. These cells are structurally arranged in a specific way to facilitate the development of a mature, functional egg. During this process, the cystoblast undergoes rapid cell division, with each daughter cell remaining connected to the others through structures called ring canals. This interconnected group of cells allows for efficient exchange of nutrients and regulatory factors, enabling the syncytial structure to collectively undergo proper oogenesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cystoblasts are regulated by a complex set of molecular signals that trigger their differentiation and growth. These signals are essential for regulating the timing and progression of cystoblast development, and disruptions in these signals can lead to defects in egg production and fertility. In addition, cystoblasts and the cysts they help form are vulnerable to environmental toxins that can impair their development and function. Understanding the regulation and function of cystoblasts is therefore critical for understanding the health of female reproductive systems across many different species.\n",

Their primary function is to produce involuntary contractions and relaxations, which help move substances through these organs. \n",
      "\n",
      "Smooth muscle cells contain a smooth appearance and lack the striations seen in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. These cells contain a spindle-like shape with a single, centrally located nucleus. The cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells is filled with actin and myosin filaments that allow for efficient contracting, and they are surrounded by a thin layer of extracellular matrix that helps maintain their structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smooth muscle cells play a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, maintaining the tone of blood vessels, and assisting in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues. In the digestive system, these cells help move food and waste materials through the intestinal tract, while in the urinary tract, they assist in controlling the flow of urine. Additionally, smooth muscle cells play a vital role in the reproductive system, helping to move the gametes through the female reproductive tract during fertilization and aiding in the delivery of the baby during childbirth. Overall, smooth muscle cells are essential for the proper functioning of many internal organs and systems within the body.\n",

      "Neuroblasts are stem cells that have the potential to differentiate into neurons and glia in the nervous system. In the nematode and protostomia, neuroblasts are found throughout development and play a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of the nervous system. During embryonic development, neuroblasts divide to produce two different cell types: neurons and glia. Each neuroblast will produce neurons that have distinct morphology and function. \n",
      "\n",
      "In nematodes, the neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce a daughter cell that will differentiate into a neuronal lineage and a smaller daughter cell that will differentiate into a glial cell. The resulting neuron will then extend processes that will connect with other neurons to form functional circuits. In Protostomia, the morphological complexity of the nervous system is higher than in nematodes. This means that neuroblasts will produce distinct neurons that contribute to central and peripheral nervous systems. Each neuron will have a specific function within the nervous system contributing to the organism’s behavior, response, and perception of the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In adult organisms, neuroblasts can differentiate into new neurons to replace and repair damaged or lost neurons in the nervous system. This process is known as neurogenesis and is essential for maintaining the proper function of the nervous system. Although the process of neurogenesis is complex and not completely understood, it has been shown to diminish during aging and in some neurological diseases. Studying neuroblast proliferation and the mechanisms behind neurogenesis holds great potential for understanding the fundamental processes of the nervous system and developing therapies for neurological diseases.\n",

These cells play a crucial role in the formation of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as they migrate extensively throughout the developing embryo, differentiating into various cell types including sensory neurons, sympathetic neurons, and Schwann cells. The NCb are highly migratory and invasive, and their ability to differentiate into a diverse range of cell types makes them a valuable cell population in regenerative medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the NCb reach their destination within the developing PNS, they differentiate into different cell types based on the signals they receive from the local microenvironment. Some NCb differentiate into sensory neurons, which detect and relay sensory information to the central nervous system (CNS), while others differentiate into sympathetic neurons and help regulate involuntary functions such as heart rate and digestion. Additionally, some NCb differentiate into Schwann cells, which provide structural and functional support to the PNS by ensheathing peripheral nerves and facilitating nerve regeneration after injury.\n",

Glioblastomas are the most aggressive and lethal form of gliomas, with a very poor prognosis and a high mortality rate. These cells are characterized by their highly invasive and fast-growing nature, making them difficult to remove surgically and resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glioblastomas arise from astrocytes, a type of glial cell that provides nutritional and structural support to neurons in the brain. Unlike normal astrocytes, glioblastomas cells divide rapidly and uncontrollably, leading to the formation of a mass of abnormal cells, or tumor, in the brain. The tumor can compress surrounding brain tissue and impede normal brain function, leading to symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and cognitive impairment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function of glioblastoma cells is to divide uncontrollably and invade surrounding healthy brain tissue. This can lead to the destruction of normal brain tissue and the interruption of normal brain function. Glioblastomas can also secrete molecules that suppress the immune system and promote blood vessel growth, allowing them to sustain their own growth and spread throughout the brain. Understanding the functions and characteristics of glioblastoma cells is essential to developing effective treatments for this aggressive and often fatal cancer.\n",

These cells can still divide and differentiate into various specialized cell types, depending on the signaling cues they receive from the surrounding environment. Non-terminally differentiated cells are essential for both development and tissue homeostasis, as they provide a reservoir of cells that can replenish damaged or lost cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "One well-known example of non-terminally differentiated cells is stem cells. These cells have the unique ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types and self-renew, which allows for both tissue regeneration and development. While stem cells are perhaps the most well-known non-terminally differentiated cells, there are many other types of non-terminally differentiated cells, such as progenitor cells and precursor cells.\n",

These unique cells make up only a small fraction of the islets, accounting for roughly 5-10% of the total population. Somatostatin is a hormone best known for its ability to inhibit the release of other hormones, acting as a type of negative feedback mechanism. Through this mechanism, somatostatin-secreting cells play a vital role in regulating the functions of many different types of cells within the pancreas.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary function of somatostatin-secreting cells is to regulate the secretion of hormones from other endocrine cells within the pancreas. When glucose levels in the bloodstream rise, beta cells in the pancreas secrete insulin to signal other cells to take up glucose for energy. However, if glucose levels rise too quickly or too high, this can lead to hyperglycemia, which can cause damage to the body over time. Somatostatin-secreting cells help prevent this by inhibiting the release of insulin when glucose levels become too high, maintaining a steady balance of glucose in the bloodstream.\n",

Ecdysteroid secreting cells are located in the prothoracic glands, which are small glands located in close proximity to the tracheal system and are part of the insect’s endocrine system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The function of the ecdysteroid secreting cell is heavily regulated by the level of juvenile hormone (JH) in the insect’s body. When JH levels are high, the prothoracic glands will not secrete ecdysteroids, and the insect will remain in a juvenile state. Conversely, when JH levels are low, the prothoracic glands will begin to secrete ecdysteroids, which triggers the molting process and ultimately leads to metamorphosis. This finely-tuned system of hormone regulation ensures that insects and crustaceans undergo metamorphosis at the appropriate time in their development, allowing them to grow and reproduce in a highly coordinated manner.\n",

      "Each skeletal muscle cell contains many thread-like structures called myofibrils, which are made up of smaller units called sarcomeres. These sarcomeres contain two types of protein filaments called actin and myosin, which slide past each other during muscle contraction. When the muscle cell receives a signal to contract, the myosin filaments pull the actin filaments closer together, causing the sarcomere to contract and the muscle cell to shorten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skeletal muscle cells are also able to adapt to changes in physical activity levels by increasing or decreasing the number of myofibrils within the cell. This process, called muscle hypertrophy or atrophy, allows the muscle to become stronger or weaker depending on the demands placed upon it. As such, the cell of skeletal muscle plays a crucial role in maintaining overall muscle strength and physical ability.\n",

These fibers are striated and elongated cells that contain myofibrils, which are specialized organelles responsible for generating force and movement within the muscle. Each extrafusal muscle fiber is innervated by a motor neuron, which triggers the release of calcium ions that activate the myofibrils, leading to muscle contraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contractile function of extrafusal muscle fibers is critical for movements such as walking, running, and jumping. These fibers are organized into motor units, which consist of a single motor neuron and the extrafusal muscle fibers that it innervates. The force generated by a motor unit is determined by the number and size of extrafusal muscle fibers that it innervates. During muscular activity, motor units are recruited in a specific order, beginning with small motor units that generate low levels of force and progressing to larger motor units that generate higher levels of force.\n",

      "Obsolete cell by lineage is a term in the Cell Ontology that refers to cells that are no longer present in an organism due to changes in the developmental lineage. These cells were once a part of the developmental pathway, but have since been replaced by other cell types. The term \"obsolete\" does not imply that these cells were unnecessary or without function, but rather that they have been replaced by other cells that are better-suited to perform the necessary functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "During development, cells undergo a process called differentiation, in which they become specialized and take on specific functions. As cells differentiate, they may follow different developmental pathways, leading to the formation of distinct cell types. In some cases, a cell type may be necessary for early development but is no longer needed as the organism matures. In these instances, the cell type may become obsolete and be replaced by other cell types that are more suited to carry out the necessary functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "While obsolete cells by lineage may no longer be present in an organism, they still play an important role in understanding the developmental history of organisms. By studying these cells and their role in development, we can gain insight into the complex processes that govern cellular differentiation and the formation of distinct cell types. Additionally, understanding these processes may provide important clues for treating developmental disorders or diseases that arise from errors in cellular differentiation.\n",

Upon injury to a blood vessel, platelets adhere to the site to prevent excessive bleeding and initiate clot formation through a complex cascade of signaling events.\n",
      "\n",
      "Platelets are highly reactive cells that interact with other blood cells and the extracellular matrix to form clots. They express numerous adhesion receptors, including GPIb/IX/V, GPVI, and integrin αIIbβ3, which allow them to bind to exposed collagen and von Willebrand factor. Upon activation, platelets secrete various factors, such as ADP, thromboxane A2, and serotonin, which amplify the recruitment of additional platelets to the injured site and promote vasoconstriction. They also expose phosphatidylserine on their surface, which provides a catalytic surface for the tenase and prothrombinase complexes, leading to the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen to fibrin, respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "The development of the obsolete stalk cell is tightly regulated by a set of signaling pathways, which activate transcription factors that drive stalk cell differentiation. Under certain conditions, such as nutrient limitation or the presence of quorum sensing signals, a subset of cells within a Dictyosteliidae colony will differentiate into obsolete stalk cells. These cells cease to proliferate and undergo a series of morphological changes, including the extension of their cellular membrane and the deposition of extracellular matrix components, which ultimately results in the formation of a stalk.\n",
      "\n",
      "The formation of the obsolete stalk cell is a remarkable example of the cellular differentiation that occurs during the development of multicellular organisms. While the mechanism of obsolete stalk cell differentiation is well-characterized, many questions remain about the signaling pathways that regulate this process, as well as the genetic and epigenetic factors that contribute to its regulation. Understanding the development of the obsolete stalk cell has important implications for the study of cellular differentiation and developmental biology.\n",

      "Hyphal cells are a unique type of elongated fungal cell that grow as branching thread-like structures. These cells are responsible for the growth and spread of filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium. Hyphal cells are characterized by their long, thin shape and lack of septa, which allows for the flow of nutrients and organelles throughout the cell. Many hyphal cells also feature branching tips, which help to increase surface area for absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main function of hyphal cells is to facilitate the growth and spread of filamentous fungi. They do this by continuing to elongate at their tips, allowing the fungus to penetrate new substrates such as soil or decaying organic matter. As the hyphae grow, they release digestive enzymes to break down surrounding organic matter, allowing the fungus to absorb the nutrients it requires for survival and growth. Additionally, some hyphal cells are specialized for reproduction, with reproductive structures such as spores forming at the tips of the hyphae.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their simple appearance, hyphal cells play a vital role in the ecology of many ecosystems. They are an important part of the carbon and nutrient cycling in soil, and some filamentous fungi have been used for centuries in the production of food and antibiotics. Hyphal cells also interact with other organisms in their environment, with some forming mutualistic relationships with plant roots and others acting as host for pathogens. Overall, the growth and function of hyphal cells are fundamental aspects of fungal biology and ecology.\n",

      "A fungal cell is a type of eukaryotic cell that forms the basic structural and functional unit of all fungi. Like other eukaryotic cells, fungal cells contain a nucleus, which houses the genetic material of the cell, as well as other membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum. However, unlike animal and plant cells, which have a variety of shapes, fungal cells typically have a simple cylindrical or spherical shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fungal cells are responsible for carrying out a range of important functions within the fungal organism. One of the primary functions of fungal cells is to produce and release enzymes that can break down complex organic molecules such as cellulose and lignin. These enzymes allow fungi to extract nutrients from a wide range of organic matter, ranging from dead plant and animal material to soil and decaying organic matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to their role in nutrient acquisition, fungal cells are also important for reproduction, allowing fungi to produce asexual spores or sexual spores that can be dispersed over long distances to form new fungal colonies.

      "The obsolete synergid is a type of cell that is found in the female gametophyte, or embryo sac, of certain plants. It is called \"obsolete\" because it does not play an active role in fertilization, despite its presence during the process. Instead, its primary function is believed to be in supporting the growth and development of the female gametophyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "During fertilization, the male gametophyte, which is contained within a pollen grain, enters the female gametophyte through a structure called the micropyle. The two sperm cells contained within the pollen grain then move towards the two synergid cells that are flanking the egg cell. One sperm cell fuses with the egg cell to form the zygote, while the other sperm cell fuses with the two synergid cells to contribute to the formation of a nutrient-rich structure called the endosperm.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the obsolete synergid does not participate in fertilization itself, it is thought to play a role in the regulation of fertilization. Research has shown that this cell type may help to prevent multiple pollen grains from fertilizing a single egg cell, which could potentially lead to embryo death. In addition, the presence of the obsolete synergid is believed to be important in triggering the events that lead to the formation and differentiation of the endosperm, which is critical for the development of the embryo.\n",

Obsolete guard cells have lost their functionality and are no longer capable of regulating stomatal aperture or conducting other functions of normal guard cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guard cells are unique in their ability to change shape and volume in response to environmental cues, such as light and moisture. In response to these cues, guard cells actively regulate the uptake and loss of water, ultimately changing the size of stomatal pores. This allows for the plant to balance the trade-off between photosynthesis and water loss, an important adaptation for survival. The ability of obsolete guard cells to undergo these changes in shape and volume is diminished, rendering them incapable of fulfilling the critical role of regulating stomatal aperture.\n",

Instead, it serves as a source of nutrients for the developing mushroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "The function of the obsolete vegetative cell is to provide nourishment for the developing fungal fruiting body, or mushroom. After haploid maternal and paternal cells fuse to form a zygote, the zygote undergoes meiosis and produces four haploid cells. Of these four cells, one develops into a fruiting body while the other three act as obsolete vegetative cells. The vegetative cells surround the developing fruiting body and provide it with nutrients. This ensures that the fruiting body develops and matures successfully.\n",

The cell receives the synaptic inputs from rod photoreceptor cells and performs a differential signal processing to transfer selective signals towards bipolar cells, thus contributing significantly to the visual signal-processing network of the retina.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obsolete socket cell is a type of interneuron that functions as a unique bridge between the photoreceptor cells and bipolar cells. This cell type is named obsolete because it was thought to be absent in mammals, whose retinas use dendritic invaginations of bipolar cells called \"invaginating\" or \"depolarizing\" ON-bipolar cells, which serve the same purpose as “socket” cells. Recent discoveries, however, suggest that certain mammals, such as rodents, also possess similar cells, indicating the potential conservancy of such retinal circuits across different species.\n",

      "Aside from their role in germ cell formation, pole cells also have a unique cell division process. They divide without cytokinesis, which is the process by which the cytoplasm of a cell divides into two daughter cells. Instead, the pole cells undergo an incomplete division where the nucleus divides but the cytoplasm remains undivided. This process is known as \"asymmetric division\" and is necessary for the formation of the opposite pole cell.

      "\n",
      "Despite their inability to produce IgM, obsolete IgM B cells still have functional B cell receptors (BCRs) on their surface that can recognize and bind to specific antigens. This allows them to play a crucial role in the activation of T cells during the immune response. When an antigen is detected by the BCR of an obsolete IgM B cell, the cell undergoes a process of maturation and differentiation that enables it to present the antigen to T cells. This in turn triggers a cascade of signals that results in the activation and proliferation of specific T cell subsets, ultimately leading to the elimination of the pathogen.\n",

However, recent research has shown that IgE B cells may have a more complex role in the immune system beyond just triggering allergic responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "When an obsolete IgE B cell encounters an allergen or parasitic antigen, it will initiate its immune response by secreting IgE antibodies. These antibodies then bind to mast cells and basophils throughout the body, activating them and leading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory chemicals. This causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as itching, swelling, and difficulty breathing. In parasitic infections, IgE antibodies can help to neutralize the parasites, preventing them from causing harm to the host.\n",

Understanding the biology of tracheal epithelial cells is critical for developing strategies to prevent and treat respiratory diseases, including those caused by inhaled pathogens and environmental pollutants.\n",
      "CL:0002202 epithelial cell of tracheobronchial tree\n",
      "Epithelial cells of the tracheobronchial tree are an important component of the respiratory system. These cells are found in the lining of the trachea and bronchi and form a continuous layer of tissue that acts as a barrier to protect the underlying tissues from damage and infection. Additionally, these cells play a critical role in the clearance of mucus and debris from the respiratory tract.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary function of epithelial cells in the tracheobronchial tree is to provide a physical barrier that prevents harmful particles, such as pollutants and pathogens, from entering the lungs. These cells are tightly packed together and are held in place by tight junctions to form a continuous layer of tissue that lines the airways. This layer of tissue is also responsible for regulating fluid and ion transport across the airway surface, which helps to maintain the proper balance of ions and fluid in the respiratory tract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Epithelial cells of the tracheobronchial tree also produce and secrete mucus, which helps to trap inhaled particles and facilitate their removal from the respiratory tract. Additionally, these cells are equipped with hair-like structures called cilia, which beat in a coordinated manner to move the mucus and trapped particles up and out of the airways. Dysfunction of these cells can lead to serious respiratory conditions such as chronic bronchitis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. Overall, the proper function of epithelial cells in the tracheobronchial tree is essential for maintaining respiratory health.\n",
      "CL:0000377 tracheoblast\n",
      "Tracheoblasts are cells found in the embryonic development of insects, which give rise to the tracheal system, the respiratory system of insects. Tracheoblasts are responsible for creating the luminal space of tracheal tubes and for establishing the branching pattern of the tracheal system. They play a crucial role in the formation of the tracheal tubes, which allows for the rapid and efficient delivery of oxygen to tissues throughout the insect body.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tracheoblasts arise from embryonic ectoderm and migrate within the developing embryo to the appropriate locations for tracheal branching. Once they have reached their final location, the tracheoblasts secrete a cuticle that forms the luminal surface of the tracheal tubes. The tracheoblasts continue to divide and differentiate into different types of tracheal cells, including the terminally differentiated cells that form the tracheal branches and tracheoles.\n",
      "\n",
      "The essential role of tracheoblasts in establishing the respiratory system of insects makes them a crucial cell type for the survival of these organisms. Without the efficient transport of oxygen, insects would not be able to carry out their energy-intensive behaviors, such as flying and reproduction. Therefore, tracheoblasts play a critical role in allowing insects to diversify and thrive within their ecological niches.\n",

Overall, the function of serous secreting cells is essential for the proper functioning and maintenance of various organ systems throughout the body.\n",
      "CL:0000314 milk secreting cell\n",
      "Milk secreting cells, also called lactocytes, are specialized epithelial cells found in the mammary glands of female mammals. These cells produce, secrete, and transport milk, which is essential for nourishing newborn offspring. Lactocytes are highly differentiated cells that synthesize and secrete milk components, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. They are responsible for the production of milk throughout lactation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk secreting cells are organized into clusters called alveoli, which are embedded in a supportive connective tissue called stroma. These cells are stimulated to proliferate and differentiate during pregnancy by hormones such as prolactin and estrogen. Once lactation is initiated, milk proteins are synthesized and secreted into the luminal space of the alveoli, where they are mixed with lipids and other milk components. The milk is then transported through a network of ducts to the nipples, where it is available for suckling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lactocytes have a high degree of plasticity, as they can switch between their fully differentiated state and a less differentiated state during breast involution. This plasticity is thought to be important for breast tissue remodeling, as well as for pathologies such as breast cancer.

      "Tear secreting cells are referred to as the lacrimal gland cells. These cells are responsible for generating the aqueous layer of the tear film that lubricates, nourishes, and protects the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye. The lacrimal gland is located in the upper outer portion of the orbit and is divided into two parts, the larger palpebral lobe, and the smaller orbital lobe. These cells are specialized epithelial cells that utilize a process called exocytosis to release proteins and glycoproteins synthesized by the ER and Golgi apparatus into the lumen of the glandular acini. These proteins act as lubricants and have antibacterial properties that protect the surface of the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, tear production is regulated by neural pathways that are activated by a variety of stimuli such as light and emotion. This leads to an increase in parasympathetic signals, which stimulates an increase in fluid and protein secretion from the lacrimal gland. Stimulation of the lacrimal gland can also be achieved by direct application of cholinergic agonists, such as pilocarpine, which causes a contraction of the myoepithelial cells that surround the secretory cells and squeeze the contents of the gland into the ductal system leading to the eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lacrimal gland cells play a crucial role in maintaining the quality of the tear film that covers the surface of the eye, thus preventing desiccation and the associated discomfort and damage.

      "CL:2000021 sebaceous gland cell\n",
      "Sebaceous gland cells are specialized epithelial cells that are primarily responsible for the production and secretion of sebum, an oily substance that lubricates and protects the skin and hair. These cells are found in the dermis layer of the skin and are connected to hair follicles. Although sebum is essential for protecting the skin and keeping it moist, overproduction of this substance can result in skin disorders such as acne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sebaceous gland cells are highly specialized in their function and utilize holocrine secretion to produce and secrete sebum. In this process, the entire cell becomes filled with lipid vacuoles, which eventually rupture and release their contents into the hair follicle. The sebum then travels up the hair shaft and onto the surface of the skin, where it helps to maintain the skin's barrier function and protect it from environmental factors such as dehydration and infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from their role in sebum production, sebaceous gland cells also play a vital role in regulating skin inflammation and immune responses.

Type I pneumocytes are flat, thin cells that make up the majority of the surface area of the alveoli, which are small air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. They form a barrier between the air in the alveoli and the blood vessels in the lung and are responsible for the exchange of gases between the two. Type II pneumocytes, on the other hand, produce and secrete a substance called surfactant that reduces surface tension within the alveoli and helps to prevent them from collapsing during exhalation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pneumocytes play a crucial role in maintaining the normal function of the respiratory system. Type I pneumocytes are responsible for the diffusion of respiratory gases, allowing oxygen to be exchanged for carbon dioxide in the lungs. Type II pneumocytes, meanwhile, produce surfactant, which helps to prevent the alveoli from collapsing during exhalation. Without surfactant, the alveoli would become stiff and could collapse, making breathing difficult or impossible.\n",
